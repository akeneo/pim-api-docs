# Introduction

The PHP client facilitates the usage of the API in your PHP projects when building extensions and/or tools for our favorite PIM.

This client is currently a **Beta** version.
Feel free to test it, experiment and do not forget to give us some feedback!

If you ever find a bug, do not hesitate to directly open a Github issue on the [API client repository](https://github.com/akeneo/php-api-client).
If you just want to discuss about it, join the community in the [#web-api](https://akeneopim-ug.slack.com/messages/web-api/) channel in our [Slack user group community](https://akeneopim-ug.herokuapp.com/).

::: info
Please keep in mind that this beta version of the client will only be fully supported once the final release is out.
