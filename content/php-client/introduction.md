# PHP developer, you are?
> We have a client for you!

The PHP client facilitates the usage of the API in your PHP projects when building extensions and/or tools for your favorite PIM.

Two clients exist: 
- a **Community Edition** client, covering the API endpoints of the PIM Community Edition
- an **Enterprise Edition** client, covering the API endpoints of both the PIM Community Edition and the PIM Enterprise Edition

There are several versions of these clients:
- The version v1.0 is compatible with the PIM 2.0.
- The version v2.0 is compatible with the PIM 2.1 and 2.2.
- The version v3.0 is compatible with the PIM 2.3.
- The version v4.0 is compatible with the PIM 3.0 and 3.1.
- The version v5.0 is compatible with the PIM 3.2 and 4.0 and the Serenity version.
- The current and latest version v6.0 is compatible with the Serenity version.

## Support & issues
Please be aware that these PHP clients are only supported **in best effort**, whether you are an Entreprise or Community customer.

If you ever find a bug, do not hesitate to directly open a Github issue on the [CE API client repository](https://github.com/akeneo/php-api-client) or the [EE API client repository](https://github.com/akeneo/php-api-client-ee).

Don't forget that we also love when you contribute and help us do better tools. So do not hesitate! Every feedback/pull request is very welcomed!
