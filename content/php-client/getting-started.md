::: info
Note that our PHP client is backward compatible.

For example, if your PIM is currently a v2.3, you can still use a 1.0 version of the PHP client.
The new endpoints available in v2.3 will not be available in the v1.0 of the PHP client.
:::


## Installation

`api-php-client` use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).
The first step is to download Composer:

```bash
$ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```
We use HTTPPlug as the HTTP client abstraction layer. If you want to know more about this, it's documented [here](/php-client/http-client.html).
In this example, we will use [Guzzle](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) v6 as the HTTP client implementation.

Run the following command to require the libraries in your project:

```bash
$ php composer.phar require akeneo/api-php-client php-http/guzzle6-adapter:^2.0 http-interop/http-factory-guzzle:^1.0
```

::: info
If you don't know which implementation to choose, we strongly recommend you to use Guzzle v6, as in the previous example.
:::

### Enterprise Edition

::: warning
Enterprise Edition and Community Edition of the client have been merged into a one and unique package.
Every user shall now use the same client package. Learn about migration instructions [here](https://github.com/akeneo/api-php-client-ee#warning-the-client-project-has-moved-warning).
:::

## Initialization of the client

You first need to initialize the client with your credentials (client id, secret, username and password).

If you don't have any client id/secret, let's take a look at [this page](/documentation/authentication.html#client-idsecret-generation) to create it.

```php
<?php

require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$clientBuilder = new \Akeneo\Pim\ApiClient\AkeneoPimClientBuilder('http://localhost/');
$client = $clientBuilder->buildAuthenticatedByPassword('client_id', 'secret', 'admin', 'admin');
```

You can authenticate to the client with your token/refresh token as well.
```php
<?php

require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$clientBuilder = new \Akeneo\Pim\ApiClient\AkeneoPimClientBuilder('http://localhost/');
$client = $clientBuilder->buildAuthenticatedByToken('client_id', 'secret', 'token', 'refresh_token');
```

Want to know more about authentication? It's over [there](/php-client/authentication.html).

## Make your first call

Getting a product is as simple as:

```
$product = $client->getProductApi()->get('top');
echo $product['identifier'];
```

Want to [update an attribute](/php-client/resources.html#upsert-an-attribute), [create a category](/php-client/resources.html#create-a-category) or [delete a product](/php-client/resources.html#delete-a-product)? You can get code snippets for all the resources [here](/php-client/resources.html)
