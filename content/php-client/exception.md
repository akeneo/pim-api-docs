# Exception handling

Every request made with the client can throw an HTTP exception.

You can read more about REST API Exception handling : [here](https://api.akeneo.com/documentation/responses.html#)

## HTTP exception (4XX)

The parent of these HTTP exceptions is `Akeneo\Pim\Exception\HttpException`.
You can get the request and the response that are responsible for this exception. Also, the HTTP response code and response message are available.
 
```php
try {
    $client->getProductApi()->get('top');
} catch (HttpException $e) {
    // do your stuff with the exception
    $requestBody = $e->getRequest()->getBody();
    $responseBody = $e->getResponse()->getBody();
    $httpCode = $e->getCode(); 
    $errorMessage = $e->getMessage(); 
}
```

 
Two types of exception inherit from this exception: server exception and client exception.

## Server exception (5XX)

A server exception thrown by the client means that the server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.
It's an HTTP code from the 5xx family.

## Client exception (4XX)

A client exception could be thrown if the client made an invalid request.
It's an HTTP code from the 4xx family.

### Bad request exception (400)

This exception is thrown if the request does not contain valid JSON. It corresponds to the HTTP code 400.

::: info

:::

### Unauthorized exception (401)

This exception is thrown if you don't have the permission to access to the resource. It corresponds to the HTTP code 401.

::: info

    $responseBody = $e->getResponse()->getBody();
    $httpCode = $e->getCode(); 
    $errorMessage = $e->getMessage(); 
    $errors = $e->getResponseErrors();
    foreach ($e->getResponseErrors() as $error) {
        // do your stuff with the error
        echo $error['property'];
        echo $error['message'];
    }
}
