# PX Insights Overview

**PX Insights** is a powerful add-on module that provides a comprehensive view of your product performance.
It works by collecting and analyzing a wide range of customer behavior and shopping signals, turning them into actionable
insights that help you grow sales and reduce returns. To learn more, visit our [help center](https://help.akeneo.com/discovering-px-insights/what-is-px-insights).

## Prerequisites

To use PX Insights and the associated API, you must:

- Be an active PX Insights customer.
- Have valid API credentials to use the PX Insights API (see “Getting Access” below).

## The Role of the PX Insights API

To ensure the PX Insights module has the most complete data set, we provide the PX Insights API. The API serves a
specific and important purpose: it allows you to feed ratings and reviews data into the module from systems that we
do not have a pre-built integration for.

This is ideal for clients who use:

- Homegrown, in-house ratings and reviews systems.
- Third-party platforms that are not natively supported by PX Insights.

## API Scope

The initial version of the PX Insights API provides access to the following signals:

- Ratings
- Reviews

Support for additional data signals will be added in future releases.
