# PX Insights Overview

**PX Insights** is an add-on module that collects & turns customer behaviors & shopping performance signals into actionable insights, so businesses can build a customer-informed product record and deliver smarter merchandising experiences to help grow sales and reduce returns.

::: warning
**Paid Add-on Subscription Required**

PX Insights is a premium add-on that requires a paid subscription. While the API will technically accept review data without an active subscription, these reviews will not be visible in your PIM interface until you have purchased and activated the add-on.

To avoid data loss and ensure seamless access to your customer insights, please contact your Akeneo representative to activate your PX Insights subscription before implementing the API integration.
