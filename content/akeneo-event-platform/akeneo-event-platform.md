# Event Platform

## Event Platform Overview

The **Event Platform** seamlessly integrates with Akeneo PIM through a subscription-based event system. External applications can subscribe to specific events triggered within Akeneo PIM, enabling faster data updates and synchronization than continuous polling.

Using our event platform ensures smooth and efficient responses to changes in your PIM, such as product updates, deletions, and other significant events, enhancing your system's responsiveness and connectivity.
