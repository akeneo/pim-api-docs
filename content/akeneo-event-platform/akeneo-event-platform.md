# Akeneo Event Platform

## Akeneo Event Platform Overview

The **Akeneo Event Platform (AEP)** seamlessly integrates with Akeneo PIM through a subscription-based event system. External applications can subscribe to specific events triggered within Akeneo PIM, enabling real-time data updates and synchronization.

AEP ensures smooth and efficient responses to changes in your PIM, such as product updates, deletions, and other significant events, enhancing your systemâ€™s responsiveness and connectivity.

## What AEP Is Not

To set the right expectations, here's what AEP is **not**:

- **Not a Data Storage Solution**: AEP streams real-time events but does not store event data permanently.
- **Not a Replacement for Akeneo PIM API**: AEP complements the Akeneo PIM API by offering event-driven capabilities but does not replace the core functionalities of the PIM API.
- **Not a Business Logic Handler**: AEP transmits events to subscribed endpoints but does not handle complex business logic or workflows.
- **Not the v2 of the Akeneo Event API**: AEP is a new platform with distinct functionalities and should not be considered as the next version of [Akeneo's Event API](https://api.akeneo.com/events-documentation/overview.html). AEP offers more granular event handling compared to the Event API.

## Requirements

Before using AEP, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

- If you want to use a Pub/Sub subscription, you need to grant the Akeneo Event Platform publishing access. Follow these steps:
    1. In the Google Cloud Console, go to **Pub/Sub > Topics**.
    2. Next to the topic you want to use, click **...** and then **View permissions**.
    3. Click **ADD PRINCIPAL**.
    4. Paste the following service account address into the **New principals** text box: `delivery-sa@akecld-prd-sdk-aep-prd.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.
    5. In the Role drop-down list, select **Pub/Sub** and then **Pub/Sub Publisher**.
    6. Click **Save**.
- HTTP is not supported. Only HTTPS is allowed.
- For HTTPS destinations, ensure your server returns a 200 status code within 3 seconds when receiving messages containing events. See the [concept page]((/akeneo-event-platform/concepts.html)) about retry / revocation policy.
- For a subscription to an HTTPS destination, the URL must be valid and return a 200 status code after a HEAD request.
- The Akeneo Event Platform does not guarantee the delivery of events in order.
- Events are delivered at least once. While we strive for reliability, duplicate events may occur, so ensure your system is idempotent to handle potential duplicates.
- You can have up to 20 subscribers for each PIM instance.
- Each subscriber can have up to 20 subscriptions.

### Authentication

- AEP uses OAuth2-based authentication to secure event transmission. Each application or connection interacting with AEP must authenticate using client credentials.
- [Obtain your OAuth2 credentials](/akeneo-event-platform/getting-started.html) from the Akeneo PIM instance you are integrating with.

### Webhook Timeout Warning

- Ensure your webhook endpoints can respond within the within 3 seconds when receiving messages containing events. AEP expects timely responses to avoid event loss or unnecessary retries.
