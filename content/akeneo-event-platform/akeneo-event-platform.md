# Akeneo Event Platform

## Akeneo Event Platform Overview

The **Akeneo Event Platform (AEP)** seamlessly integrates with Akeneo PIM through a subscription-based event system. External applications can subscribe to specific events triggered within Akeneo PIM, enabling faster data updates and synchronization than continuous polling.

AEP ensures smooth and efficient responses to changes in your PIM, such as product updates, deletions, and other significant events, enhancing your systemâ€™s responsiveness and connectivity.
