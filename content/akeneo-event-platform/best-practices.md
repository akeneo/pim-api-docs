# Best practices

## Handling 429 Responses for HTTPS destinations

The platform can send many events in a short time, potentially causing overload and leading to `500` responses from your side. In such cases, your subscription may be suspended. By implementing a proper `429` response mechanism, you can delay event processing to maintain service stability and avoid suspension.

If your 429 responses contains a `Retry-after` header, the platform **will not take it into account**, the event will enter the [retry mecanism]((/akeneo-event-platform/concepts.html#retry-policy)).

## Suspending and Resuming Subscriptions

If you are unable to guarantee a positive response when events are sent (e.g. during infrastructure maintenance) you may decide to **`suspend/resume`** your subscription to avoid it being suspended in accordance with our [suspension policy](/akeneo-event-platform/concepts.html#suspension-policy).
During the **suspension period**, events in the pipeline and new events generated by the PIM **`can't be recovered`**.
You'll be able to receive new events as soon as you resume the subscription.

## Ignoring Duplicate Events

Due to the scalable and distributed nature of our service, in addition with its ability to provide some retry capability in case of temporary failure, you might receive the same event multiple times. To identify and handle these duplicate events, you can rely on the `id` of the event. This allows you to process each event only once and maintain data integrity.

## Implement Reconciliation Processes

Your app shouldn't rely solely on receiving data from the Akeneo Event Platform. Because you may not receive events if you suspend your subscription or your server is not able to handle them during the maximum retry period, you should implement reconciliation jobs to periodically fetch data from the PIM.

You could do this in the background or offer reconciliation and syncing options to the user. For example, your app's UI could contain a button that triggers a manual reconciliation process by calling the relevant API endpoint and fetching the requested data.
