# Akeneo App Certification

Akeneo App Certification is a certification program aiming at promoting Partner Apps that meet the certification criteria defined by Akeneo as a part of its quality approach on [the App Store](https://apps.akeneo.com/apps).

## Program Scope

Only Apps are concerned by the Program - Bundles or Connectors are excluded from the scope of the App Certification Program.

## Benefits of Certification

As part of the Certification Program, your Akeneo Certified App will benefit from the following:
- Appear first in the Apps list on the App Store
- Akeneo Quality label
- Your App will be promoted by Akeneo

## Application Process
:::To be considered for this program, your app must be listed in the Akeneo App Store. [Learn more](https://api.akeneo.com/app-portal/publish-your-app.html).

[Become a Partner](https://www.akeneo.com/become-an-akeneo-partner/)::::

At Akeneo, we believe that an App that has never been used by a customer has not lived long enough.

And so, any App applying for the Certification Program should have been used in a production environment for a minimum of two months by two different Akeneo clients.

After you confirm that you meet all of [the certification requirements](#certification-requirements), you're ready to apply:

- [Apply for Certification Program](https://apps-support.akeneo.com/)

After submitting your application request, the Akeneo App Certification Team will work with you to ensure that all certification criteria are met. This process could last a maximum of one month.

If your App meets the requirements, Akeneo grants you an Akeneo App Certification label valid for one year. This label can be renewed if the partner passes the certification again.

In the event that the App does not comply with the certification criteria, Akeneo has the authority to withdraw the certification from the App partner. However, the partner can regain certification once all necessary corrections have been implemented and validated by Akeneo. It's important to note that Akeneo may modify its certification process and criteria on an annual basis.

Please note that Akeneo is not liable for any issues that may arise from the use of the app or its features by the Customer. While the certification process evaluates specific criteria, it does not ensure that the app will function correctly in the customer's environment or guarantee interoperability.

## Certification Requirements

### 1- Complete Documentation

Your app needs to have comprehensive documentation that can assist users in fully comprehending its functionality, as well as its boundaries and limitations.
- To make the App documentation accessible to a wider audience, it must be written in English.
- Include a "How to set up the App" section: The documentation should contain a section detailing the process of setting up the App as well as a section explaining how to use it.
- Include a "How to use the App" section.
- The documentation must inform users of any known limitations of the App, including its performance and scalability.
- The App documentation must be publicly available through the App Store page.

### 2- [Feature List](https://api.akeneo.com/app-portal/manage-app-information.html#feature-list)

When presenting your App on the App Store, the "Feature list" is a helpful tool for outlining its scope. This list is displayed alongside other information about your App.
It is important for you to ensure that the App Feature list is fully completed.

### 3- Support Assistance

An Akeneo PIM user should be able to report a bug or a problem with your App, and in return, you, as an Akeneo Partner, should be able to respond quickly to help him.
- Support service for the App is a must-have.
- This support service must be offered through a support contract.
- The support contract must contain information on how to report an issue or submit a question.
- The support contract must include information on the response time and processing time after reporting a bug or submitting a question.

### 4- Security Checks Requirements

As part of the App Certification Program, your company must perform at least an annual security assessment of your app, including but not limited to vulnerability assessments and penetration tests to guarantee:
We require that App partners sign the **App Security Charter** (details below) to commit to a certain number of security verification points for their App:

| PIM accesses scope   | The App owner commits to offering the PIM user only the PIM permissions the App needs to work properly (no unused access granted). |
| OAuth 2 security     | The App owner commits to storing the “OAuth 2.0 client credentials” delivered by the App Store (client_secret) and the “access token” securely and to make every effort to ensure that no third party can retrieve this information. [Learn more](https://api.akeneo.com/apps/authentication-and-authorization.html#oauth-20) |
| Hosting                  | The App owner commits to checking that the App hosting service guarantees that no unwanted access to the App can be made. |
| Code                      | The App owner commits to making every effort to ensure that its code does not contain any security vulnerabilities. The App owner commits to keeping up-to-date to the least maintained version of external libraries (not owned by the App owner) but used by the App. The App owner commits to fixing in the shortest possible time any security vulnerability that is communicated to him. |
| PIM data fair usage   | The App owner commits to performing sufficient testing to avoid unwanted changes to PIM data that could result in product data corruption. |
| API fair usage          | The App owner commits to respect PIM [API fair usage recommendations](https://api.akeneo.com/documentation/overview.html#fair-usage-protection). |

### 5- Have a Standardized Name

An App should have a name that is clearly identifiable by App Store users to avoid any confusion regarding the third-party solution it addresses.
- Technology partner's App name: **Your third-party solution name + “App”** (e.g., Bynder App)
- Solution partner's App name: **Your third-party solution name + “App by” + partner name** (e.g., Commercetools App by Viamo)
