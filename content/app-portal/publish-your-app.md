# App Publication Requirements

Thanks to you, the Akeneo App Store continues to grow. It has become increasingly important for us to review the submission process for new apps to maintain the quality standards that Akeneo users expect. By doing this, we will ensure that the Akeneo App Store remains a valuable resource for our joint customers.

The requirements to submit an integration on Akeneo App Store are listed below.

::: warning
You must meet the following criteria to go live on the Akeneo App Store.
Otherwise, your app submission will not be approved.
:::

## Your app must bring value to our joint customers

We know that it can be challenging to create a first version of an app that is  comprehensive enough to suit all of our joint customers.

Investing in an app can be costly depending on its complexity, and we recommend an agile approach to gradually address all needed use cases.

That being said, **Akeneo will be particularly vigilant to ensure that your app meets the following criteria:**

::: warning
**The first version of your app must already bring value to our joint customers.**
 From its very first version, your integration must offer a way to help PIM users to **import, enrich or export** product information.
We will not accept 'promotional' apps to simply showcase a partnership between you and Akeneo.

**Your app must also bring value compared to the apps already featured on the App Store. We won't accept duplicates.**
It's important to compare your app features with those of your competitors. We believe it's not in the interest of our joint customers to find two apps on the App Store that do exactly the same thing in the same manner.
Please list your differentiators on your App Store listing.
:::

## Your app must have comprehensive information

We want to make sure that our joint customers have all the information they need to understand how your app will help them accelerate their business.

We also want our customers to understand what your app does but also what it doesn‚Äôt do yet.

This should help prevent any blocking situations due to a lack of information in your app description or documentation.

Also this information should be kept up to date: don't forget to regularly update your app information each time you release a new app update.

**Akeneo will be particularly vigilant to ensure that your app meets the following criteria:**

### App Name (Mandatory)

- If your integration connects Akeneo PIM to a third-party software, then the name of your integration **must contain the name of the third-party software**.

## Your app must guarantee a certain level of security

Because your app will either pull data from Akeneo to external services or push data to enrich the Akeneo PIM, your app must comply with Akeneo security policies. Each app which will be submitted for publication will be reviewed and will need to meet the security requirements described below. You'll also find more information and tips on the [security requirements page](/apps/secure-your-app.html) to improve the security of your app.

### Security Publication Process

Before any app is accepted into our App Store, we scan it for potential security issues.
The Akeneo Security team will perform the following tests on the source code of the app to be published: 

- Source Composition Analysis to detect vulnerabilities on the dependencies your code is using.
- Secrets Scanning to detect potential secret management security flaws.
- OWASP Top 10-based Static Application Security Testing (SAST). 
- Docker image vulnerability scanning if applicable.

If a potential security issue is detected on your app during the tests, we'll notify you to help you quickly address the issue and help keep your users safe.

::: warning
**Important**: In order to check the security of your app, you must deliver your app code to Akeneo. **Akeneo commits to not sharing your source code with any third party, and to deleting it once the scan has been completed**.
:::

### Submitting your code

Your App source code must be provided as part as the App Submission process.
- The source code¬†**MUST**¬†be provided as a .zip archive, following this specific format:¬†*<name_of_your_app>*.zip. Please reach your Akeneo contact for more information.

## You must guarantee a certain level of service related to your app

### Lead management and commitment to responsiveness

We want to be sure you‚Äôre not going to miss out on important opportunities you may have via the App Store.

Your app page has a "Request more information" button and by default, all members of your organization on the App Store will receive an email notification each time a new client requests more information.

Once your App has been submitted, please make sure that all the business or presale contact persons in your organization have been added on the App Store.
**Double-check that the notifications are correctly directly to the interested parties**.

**Akeneo will be particularly vigilant to ensure that your service meets the following criteria:**
::: warning
We ask all our App partners to commit to a quick response within 24 business hours to any customer request made via the ‚ÄúRequest more information‚Äù button.
:::

### Support and SLA

We pay particular attention to the satisfaction of our joint customers when it comes to the maintenance of your app.

That's why we feel it's important for you to commit to the availability of your support teams and their ability to respond to any bugs reported on your App.

**Akeneo will be particularly vigilant to ensure that your support service meets the following criteria:**
::: warning
- You must offer a quality support service for your app.
- The specific terms of your support service must be clear and available via the app documentation or via a dedicated support contract.
- The support service must have associated SLA (**Service-level agreement**).
:::


## Your app must have passed the necessary tests to guarantee a certain level of quality.

**Functional tests must have been performed on your app before submission to confirm it works with an Akeneo PIM instance.**

Before we approve your app on Akeneo App Store, we will check whether you performed functional tests or not. These tests will ensure your App is ready for installation on a PIM environment.    

::: warning
You must also demonstrate your contribution to Akeneo App Store team through a live demo or a video hosted on a streaming platform.**
:::

### Mandatory tests

Quality is a MUST, and we urge you to run as many tests as possible to ensure your App works well for any type of product catalog.  

Although we do not certify apps on the Akeneo App Store, Akeneo teams will always expect durable, efficient, and scalable apps.  


**Code quality tests**

Are you using the proper coding conventions?

Make sure you take advantage of online tools, such as [PHPCheckstyle](http://phpcheckstyle.github.io/), for those using PHP language.  
To check if your code has common programming flaws like unused variables, empty cache blocks, or unnecessary object creation, you could also rely on [PMD](https://pmd.github.io/) to improve your developments.  

These tests will be essential if your extension aims to be open-source, as it will help others to contribute.  


**Unit tests**

Each menu and each feature of your app should work properly in a PIM environment.  

Tools like [PHPunit](https://phpunit.de/) or [PHPSpec](http://www.phpspec.net/en/stable/) will help you conduct unit tests to confirm it does.  


**Functional tests**

Functional tests should be conducted based on the user stories you have defined during the scoping of your app.  


**Scalability and Performance tests**

Thanks to Akeneo PIM capabilities, our users can scale their activity and centralize hundreds, thousands, or up to millions of products.  
Running scalability tests will challenge the performance of your extension for large amounts of data and help identify potential ways to improve it.
