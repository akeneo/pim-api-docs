# App Publication Requirements

Thanks to you, the Akeneo App Store continues to grow. It has become increasingly important for us to review the submission process for new apps to maintain the quality standards that Akeneo users expect. By doing this, we will ensure that the Akeneo App Store remains a valuable resource for our joint customers.

The requirements to submit an integration on Akeneo App Store are listed below.

::: warning
You must meet the following criteria to go live on the Akeneo App Store.
Otherwise, your app submission will not be approved.
:::

## Your app must bring value to our joint customers

We know that it can be challenging to create a first version of an app that is functionally comprehensive enough to suit all of our joint customers.

Investing in an app can be costly depending on its complexity, and we recommend an agile approach to gradually address all needed use cases.

Also we can help you to

That being said, **Akeneo will be particularly attentive to ensure that your app meets the following criteria:**

::: warning
**From the first version of your app, it must bring value to our joint customers.**
 From its very first version, your integration must offer a way to help PIM users to **import, enrich or export** product information.
We will not accept 'promotional' app that simply indicates a partnership between you and Akeneo.

**Your app must also bring value compared to the apps already present on the App Store. We won't accept duplicates**
It's important to compare your app features with those of your competitors. We believe it's not in the interest of our joint customers to find two apps on the App Store that do exactly the same thing in the same manner.
Please list your differentiators on your App Store listing.

## Your app must guarantee a certain level of security

As your app will either pull data from Akeneo to external services or push data to enrich the Akeneo PIM, your app must be compliant with Akeneo security policies. Each app which will be submitted to publication will be reviewed according to the security requirements described below.

### Security Publication Process

To ensure the compliance with the different subjects aforementionned, Akeneo will perform security tests on your application source code prior to your app publication.

**To perform this action:**

- You must provide your app source code to Akeneo
    - The source code¬†**MUST**¬†be provided as a .zip archive, under the format¬†*<name_of_your_app>*.zip.
    - You can also give access to your Source Version Control tool to your Akeneo contact.
- Akeneo will perform security tests on your source code based on the requirements presented on this page.
- You will then be contacted to discuss the results of the tests in case vulnerabilities are detected.

### Confidentiality

Akeneo commits to only use the source code for this very use. Your source code will be deleted at the end of the publication process or a month after the first scan.

::: warning
**Important: In order to check the security of your app, you must deliver your app code to Akeneo as a Zip archive (or an access to your Github)**

Akeneo will then perform a security scan on your code and provide you with the corresponding Security report.

**Confidentiality: Akeneo commits to not sharing your source code with any third party, and to deleting it once the scan has been completed.**
:::

## You must guarantee a certain level of service around your app

### Lead management and commitment on responsiveness

We want to be sure you‚Äôre not going to miss out on important opportunities you may have via the App Store.

Your app page has a "Request more information" button and by default, all members of your organization on the App Store will receive an email notification each time a new client requests more information.

After your App submission, please check that, on the App Store, in your company organization, you invited all people needed to perform this action (commercial or presale contacts).

**Akeneo will be particularly attentive to ensure that your service meets the following criteria:**
::: warning
We ask all our App partners to commit to a quick response within 24 business hours to any customer request made via the ‚ÄúRequest more information‚Äù button.
:::

### Support and SLA

We pay particular attention to the satisfaction of our joint customers when it comes to the maintenance of your App.

That's why we feel it's important for you to commit to the availability of your support teams and their ability to respond to any bugs reported on your App.

**Akeneo will be particularly attentive to ensure that your support service meets the following criteria:**
::: warning
- You must offer a quality support service related to the App.
- The exact condition of this support service must be clear and available via the App documentation or via a dedicated support contract.
- The support service must have associated SLA (**Service-level agreement**).
:::


## Your App must have passed the necessary tests to guarantee a certain level of quality.

**Functional tests have been performed on your App before submission to confirm it works with an Akeneo PIM instance.**

Before we approve your App on Akeneo App Store, we will check whether you performed functional tests or not. These tests will ensure your App is ready to install on a PIM environment.    

::: warning
You must also demonstrate your contribution to Akeneo App Store team through a live demo or a video hosted on a streaming platform.**
:::

### Mandatory tests

Quality is a MUST, and we urge you to run as many tests as possible to ensure your App works well for any type of product catalog.  

Although we do not certify App on the Akeneo App Store, Akeneo teams will always expect durable, performant, and scalable extensions.  


**Code quality tests**

Are you using the proper coding conventions?

Ensure you take advantage of online tools, such as [PHPCheckstyle](http://phpcheckstyle.github.io/), for those using PHP language.  
To check if your code has common programming flaws like unused variables, empty cache blocks, or unnecessary object creation, you could also rely on [PMD](https://pmd.github.io/) to improve your developments.  

These tests will be essential if your extension aims to be open-source, as it will help others to contribute.  


**Unit tests**

Each menu and each feature of your extensions should work properly in a PIM environment.  

Tools like [PHPunit](https://phpunit.de/) or [PHPSpec](http://www.phpspec.net/en/stable/) will help you conduct unit tests to confirm it does.  


**Functional tests**

Functional tests should be conducted based on the user stories you have defined during the scoping of your extension.  


**Scalability and Performance tests**

Thanks to Akeneo PIM capabilities, our users can scale their activity and centralize hundreds, thousands, or up to millions of products.  
Running scalability tests will challenge the performance of your extension for large amounts of data and help identify potential ways to improve it.
