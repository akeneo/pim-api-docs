# Manage your app notifications

With the notification subscription option, you can now stay up-to-date with app activation requests and new submissions effortlessly.

## How Does It Work?

Notification Subscription allows you to "subscribe" to specific activities within the app. Currently, you can subscribe to two main categories of notifications: **app activation requests** and **new submissions** (new modifications to review). This means that whenever there is an update or action related to these categories, you will receive a notification, ensuring you are always in the loop.

## How to Get Started

Getting started with Notification Subscription is simple. Just follow these easy steps:

1. **Go to Your App**

   Log in to your account on the [App Store Admin Portal](https://manage.apps.akeneo.com/).

2. **Select Your Notification Preferences**

   Once you're logged in, navigate to your notification settings from your user profile.

3. **Choose What to Track**

   In the Notification Subscription section, you will see two options: "Track Activation Requests" and "Track New Submissions." You can select one or both of these options based on your preferences. By doing so, you're essentially subscribing to notifications for these activities.

## Managing Your Subscriptions

You're in control! You can always manage your subscriptions to ensure you're only receiving notifications that matter to you. Here's how:

**View Your Subscriptions:**

To see a list of all the apps you've subscribed to, simply go to your user profile and look for the "Notifications" or "Subscription" section. There, you'll find a list of the apps and activities you're currently tracking.

**Unsubscribe:**

If you find that you're receiving notifications for apps or activities that are no longer relevant or necessary, you can easily unsubscribe. Within the same Notifications or Subscription section, look for the option to unsubscribe or remove the unnecessary subscriptions.

## Why Use Notification Subscription?

1. **Stay Informed:** Never miss a beat when it comes to app activation requests or new submissions. Be in the know about important updates and changes within the app.

2. **Customized Experience:** Tailor your notifications to suit your needs. Choose what matters most to you, and leave out the rest.

3. **Efficiency:** Save time by receiving notifications directly related to your interests. No more sifting through unrelated alerts.
