# Who is your App intended for?

Because we want to give our PIM users the best experience to connect Akeneo PIM with third-parties by providing them easy-to-connect, configurable & interactive Apps on our App Store, you need to understand who is Julia and her needs.

## Understand Julia

Julia is the persona we use to help you guide your decisions about product features, interactions, and even visual design of your App.

Julia, PIM user, is also the end-user of your App, she has no technical skills, she wants to spend more time building versus operating her business. She is looking for a faster, more effective way to manage her marketing projects.

## Julia's needs

Julia needs an easy and quick way to translate her product information.

So she needs:

* An **easy way** to select, in her Akeneo PIM, the products she wants to translate via your online translation solution.

* For the selected products, a **friendly UI** allowing her to choose:
  * into which language(s) the products need to be translated.
  * the deadline.
  * a project name to track this translation process in her online translation tool.

* A **friendly UI** to be able to track directly in the PIM if the products have been translated.

* A **complete and easy-to-read online documentation** to understand all the features of your App and how to use it.

* A **support contract** to ask for assistance and get quick support from you.
