# Define the scope of your first version

## Which version / edition of the PIM should my connector be “compatible” with?

As [mentioned before](step2-understand-akeneo-pim.html), there are [several editions](https://www.akeneo.com/compare-editions/) and several supported version of Akeneo PIM.

Of course, the choice of the PIM version/edition depends on your business but we strongly encourage you to develop a connector that is fully compatible with our latest **SaaS editions**.

Please, [start here](https://api.akeneo.com/getting-started/connect-the-pim-4x/welcome.html) to connect the PIM with the REST API!

## Which eCommerce solution versions should my connector be compatible with?

It depends on your eCommerce solution and your business strategy.

You have to choose these versions according to:
* The number of potential users owning this version.
* The lifetime of this version. It is useless to specifically develop a version compatible with a version of your eCommerce solution if this one won't exist anymore in a couple of months.

## What are Akeneo's recommendations to build the first iteration of an eCommerce connector release?

**Our recommendation: always listen to your customer's needs first!**

We are aware that it is difficult and expensive in terms of investment to achieve a 100% complete eCommerce connector that is flexible enough to adapt to any customer project.

Furthermore, to build such a complex connector as an eCommerce connector in a single iteration would undoubtedly be too complex to specify.

**Our advice: adopt an Agile approach!**

* Interview your future potential customers about their needs
* Set priorities based on the most generic needs
* Develop in successive iterations
