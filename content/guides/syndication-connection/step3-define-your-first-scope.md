Of course, the choice of the PIM version/edition depends on your business but we strongly encourage you to develop a connector that is fully compatible with our latest **Serenity edition**.

To know more about the different PIM versions, don't hesitate to consult our blog section on our [PIM release cycle](https://www.akeneo.com/blog/akeneo-introduces-a-simpler-product-release-cycle/).

You can also consult our [release notes](https://www.akeneo.com/release-notes/) and our ["new key features released" page](https://help.akeneo.com/pim/serenity/whats-new.html) to understand more about the latest Akeneo supported **versions** and their brand new features.

Well, now you can [start here](https://api.akeneo.com/getting-started/connect-the-pim-4x/welcome.html) to connect your syndication solution with our API! 🚀

## Step by step

**Our recommendation: always listen to your customer's needs first!**

We are aware that it is difficult and expensive in terms of investment to achieve a 100% complete syndication connector that is flexible enough to adapt to any customer project.

Furthermore, to build such a complex connector as a syndication connector in a single iteration would undoubtedly be too complex to specify.

**Our advice: adopt an Agile approach!**

* Interview your future potential customers about their needs
* Set priorities based on the most generic needs
* Develop in successive iterations
