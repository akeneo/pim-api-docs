You can also consult our [release notes](https://www.akeneo.com/release-notes/) and our ["new key features released" page](https://help.akeneo.com/pim/serenity/whats-new.html) to understand more about the latest Akeneo supported **versions** and their brand new features.

## Step by step

**Our recommendation: always listen to your customer's needs first!**

We are aware that it is difficult and expensive in terms of investment to achieve a 100% complete syndication connector that is flexible enough to adapt to any customer project.

Furthermore, to build such a complex connector as a syndication connector in a single iteration would undoubtedly be too complex to specify.

**Our advice: adopt an Agile approach!**

* Interview your future potential customers about their needs
* Set priorities based on the most generic needs
* Develop in successive iterations
