# Define the scope of your first version

## Find your PIM compatibility

As [mentioned before](step2-understand-akeneo-pim.html), there are [several editions](https://www.akeneo.com/compare-editions/) and several supported version of Akeneo PIM.

Of course, the choice of the PIM version/edition depends on your business but we strongly encourage you to develop an App that is fully compatible with our latest **SaaS editions**.

To know more about the different PIM versions, don't hesitate to consult our blog section on our [PIM release cycle](https://www.akeneo.com/blog/akeneo-introduces-a-simpler-product-release-cycle/).

You can also consult our [release notes](https://www.akeneo.com/release-notes/) and our ["new key features released" page](https://help.akeneo.com/pim/serenity/whats-new.html) to understand more about the latest Akeneo supported **versions** and their brand new features.

## Follow the guide to build an App!

We have a ["complete guide"](https://api.akeneo.com/apps/overview.html) to understand how to build an App.

## Step by step

**Our recommendation: always listen to your customer's needs first!**

We are aware that it is difficult and expensive in terms of investment to achieve a 100% complete syndication App that is flexible enough to adapt to any customer project.

Furthermore, to build such a complex App as a syndication App in a single iteration would undoubtedly be too complex to specify.

**Our advice: adopt an Agile approach!**

* Interview your future potential customers about their needs
* Set priorities based on the most generic needs
* Develop in successive iterations
