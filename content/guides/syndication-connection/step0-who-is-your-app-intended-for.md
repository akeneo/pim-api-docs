# Who is your App intended for?

Because we want to give our PIM users the best experience to connect Akeneo PIM with third-parties by providing them easy-to-connect, configurable & interactive Apps on our App Store, you need to understand who is Julia and her needs.

## Understand Julia

Julia is the persona we use to help you guide your decisions about product features, interactions, and even visual design of your App.

Julia, PIM user, is also the end-user of your App, she has no technical skills, she wants to spend more time building versus operating her business. She is looking for a faster, more effective way to manage her marketing projects.

## Julia's needs

* An **easy to follow configuration process** to configure the App.

* An **easy to follow process** to import automatically her PIM data into your Syndication solution.

* An **easy to follow strategy** to define the periodicity of these automatic imports.

* A **friendly UI** to trigger manually the App if needed (full or partial imports on demand)

* A **friendly UI** to log all automatic and manual import processes and a notification system to be alerted when something goes wrong.

* A **complete and easy-to-read online documentation** to understand all the features of your App and how to use it.

* A **support contract** to ask for assistance and get quick support from you.
