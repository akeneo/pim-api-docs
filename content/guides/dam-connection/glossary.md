# Glossary

To better understand what we are talking about, have a look at Akeneo PIM [Asset manager concepts](/concepts/asset-manager.html).

Every DAM (Digital Asset Manager) third-party system is different. Anyway, we defined global concepts for the DAM:
- **DAM asset**: This is the representation of the asset from the DAM. 
As it differs from one DAM third-party system to another, we cannot dive into its definition.
We differentiate assets coming from a DAM third-party system and assets pushed into Akeneo PIM. 
- **DAM property**: A property is the pending side of an asset attribute but for a DAM asset.
- **DAM asset value**: It's a data value of a property of a DAM asset.
