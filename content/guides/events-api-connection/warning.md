# Limitations

https://api.akeneo.com/events-documentation/limits-and-scalability.html

## No retry

Unfortunately, we donâ€™t have such a retry mechanism in our event API connection.
This means that if a message is not published, no mechanism will try to do it again, and the message will be forever lost...

## Requests limitation

For some scalability issues and to avoid overflowing the endpoint, the number of requests is limited to 4000 per hour.

## No 100% uptime

Since event API delivery is not always guaranteed, you should consider implementing a job which periodically fetch data from the PIM.

## No message ordering

Because activating the Pub/Sub message ordering property might increase latency, it is not available in our Event API.
So, be careful when you treat your messages: it is possible to recieve a product updated event before its creation.
