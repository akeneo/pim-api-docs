# _Step 3_ | Identify your connector in the PIM

In the very first step of this tutorial, you created in the PIM a connection.  
In this step, we are going to associate this connection to the connector you've built (or downloaded from the marketplace).

By doing so, you will be able to easily monitor the data flows that are exchanged between your connector and the PIM.

1. In your PIM, go under `System`/`Connections`.
2. In the overview of all your connections, click on the one we created in step 1, aka `My ERP`.
3. In the `Credentials` section of the screen, you will find the "key" to the binding between your connection and your connectors: the credentials.

4. Thanks to the _copy_ icon on the left side of the table, copy each credential field: the client id, the secret, the username and password.

5. Paste them into your connector so that your connector will use these credentials to be authentified over the API.

That's it! :tada:

Whenever your connector will start making API calls, you will be able to check whether your connector is actually working. Indeed, we got you covered with the **Connection dashboard**.  
To access this screen, click on the `Activity` menu and then on the `Connection dashboard` submenu.

You can follow here the number of products that were updated or created during the last seven days. In our tutorial, it's perfect, because we are updating/creating products coming from our ERP. So we can verify that products are actually created/updated by our connector. ðŸ˜Š

::: info
In 4.0, you can only follow the creation and update of products through the Connection dashboard. But don't worry, in next versions, you will be able to also follow the distribution of products sent to your various destinations, in the case you chose `Destination`as your connection flow type. So stay tuned!

And... that's it! :tada: You now know how to properly connect the PIM. :wink:
