## Prerequisites

<i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> **You have access to a 4.x Akeneo PIM.**  
This can seem pretty obvious. But yeah! You will need a PIM if you want to connect it to any third parties.  
And of course, you also have to make sure that you can access it from where you are requesting.
::: info
This tutorial is dedicated to 4.x PIM. If you are working on a previous PIM version, we also got you covered! :wink: There is a tutorial for you right [here](/guides/getting-started/create-a-connector-old/welcome.html).

<i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> **You already know to which third party you want to connect your PIM.**  
You want to connect the PIM. Right? But the question is _"To which third-party?"_.

It can be one of the following: an ERP, a DAM, an ecommerce platform, a syndication platform, a translation tool, a publishing tool... You name it! Pick one for which you need a connection with your PIM.

As an example, in this tutorial, we will consider that we want to connect the PIM to your ERP.

You will also have to know the use case for your connection.  
In this tutorial, for our ERP example, let's say each day, new products are referenced into my ERP. I want those new products to be sent over to my PIM so that I can enrich them, in the PIM, the day after.

You'll see the first part of this tutorial is not technical at all. But a time will come where you will have to take out your keyboard and start coding.
