> How to create your very first connector by using the API on a 4.x PIM

## Goal
Indeed, our API is perfect to create connectors. This way you can connect and:
- push data coming from third parties directly and automatically into your PIM, to create or enrich products for example,
- exchange data from your PIM to other softwares inside or outside your IT environment, in order to distribute your enriched products to whatever platforms you might have in mind.

## Prerequisites

<i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> **You have access to a 4.x Akeneo PIM.**  
This can seem pretty obvious. But yeah! You will need a PIM if you want to connect it to any third parties.  
And of course, you also have to make sure that you can access it from where you are requesting.
::: info
This tutorial is dedicated to 4.x PIM. If you are working on a previous PIM version, we also got you covered! :wink: There is a tutorial for you right [here](/guides/getting-started/create-a-connector-old).

<i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> **You already know to which third party you want to connect your PIM.**  
It can be one of the following: an ERP, a DAM, an ecommerce platform, a syndication platform, a translation tool, a publishing tool... You name it! Pick one for which you need a connection with your PIM.

<i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> **You have some technical skills (or you know someone that is willing to help you :wink:)**  
You'll see the first part of this tutorial is not technical at all. But a time will come where you will have to take out your keyboard and start coding.
