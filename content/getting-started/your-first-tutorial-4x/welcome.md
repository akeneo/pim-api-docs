# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to this tutorial!

This tutorial will teach you:
> How to make your very first REST API request on a 4.0 or newer PIM

## Goal
This is the very first tutorial to follow. At the end, you will have:
- declared a new connection into the PIM,
- obtained your credentials to authenticate yourself with the REST API,
- received products from your PIM by using the REST API.

## Prerequisite

<i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> **You have access to a 4.0 or newer Akeneo PIM.**  
This can seem pretty obvious. But yeah! You will need a PIM if you want to make any REST API requests.  
And of course, you also have to make sure that you can access it from where you are requesting.
::: info
This tutorial is dedicated to 4.0 or newer PIM. If you are working on a previous PIM version, we also got you covered! :wink: There is a tutorial for you right [here](/getting-started/your-first-tutorial-old/welcome.html).
