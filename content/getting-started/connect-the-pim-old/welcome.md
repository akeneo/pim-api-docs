> How to connect the PIM with the REST API on a v1.7, v2 or v3 PIM

## Goal

Connections will be achieved with the help of the REST API, as the REST API is the best way to connect the PIM. Wondering why? Discover the reasons [here](/documentation/introduction.html#why-should-you-use-our-api)!

## Prerequisites

<i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> **You have access to a a v1.7, v2 or v3 Akeneo PIM.**  
This can seem pretty obvious. But yeah! You will need a PIM if you want to connect it to any third parties.  
And of course, you also have to make sure that you can access it from where you are requesting.
::: info
This tutorial is dedicated to version of the PIM older than the v4. If you are working on a PIM v4 or newer, we also got you covered! :wink: There is a tutorial for you right [here](/getting-started/connect-the-pim-4x/welcome.html).
::: 

<i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> **You already know to which third party you want to connect your PIM.**  
It can be one of the following: an ERP, a DAM, an ecommerce platform, a syndication platform, a translation tool, a publishing tool... You name it! Pick one for which you need a connection with your PIM.

As an example, in this tutorial, we will consider that we want to connect the PIM to your ERP.

You will also have to know the use case for your connection.  
In this tutorial, for our ERP example, let's say every day, new products are referenced into your ERP. You want those new products to be sent over to your PIM so that you can enrich them, in the PIM, the day after.

That's it! :tada:
