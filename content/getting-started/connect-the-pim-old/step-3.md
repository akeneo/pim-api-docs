# Configure your connector

Thanks to step 1, you now have a wonderful connector.  
Thanks to step 2, you now have:
- a username,
- a password for this user,
- a client ID,
- a secret.

Let's now configure your connection with the credentials!

## Step by step
Give this set of credentials to the connector you cooked in step 1.  
They will authenticate all its API calls.

You can now use your connector for real and test the entire workflow, from the product creation in your ERP to their creation into the PIM, for our tutorial example.

And... that's it! :tada: You now know how to properly connect the PIM. :wink:
