This tutorial will teach you:
> How to synchronize PIM product data with your App

## Goal
At the end of this tutorial and thanks to the REST API, all your product data from your PIM will be persisted in your App storage.

::: info
This guide is dedicated to Apps that need to import data from a PIM (e-Commerce, Syndication, CMS, print ...).
:::

## Prerequisite

<i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> **You have access to a PIM.**  
This can seem pretty obvious. But yeah! You will need a PIM if you want to make any REST API requests.
And of course, you also have to make sure that you can access it from where you are requesting.
Our recommendation is to have access to a PIM Enterprise Edition SaaS to benefit from the latest features we have released. You need to know that Apps are available since version 6 of the PIM. 

You don't have access to a PIM to develop your App?  Don't worry!
Please [contact us](https://www.akeneo.com/contact/), we will be happy to provide you with a PIM Enterprise Edition SaaS sandbox.

<i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> **You have access to an App, and it has its own storage system.**
Whatever is the storage system, you will need one for product data persistence.
You don't know what an App is? Have a look at [our documentation](/apps/introduction.html) about this brand-new way of connecting with Akeneo PIM.

<i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> **You already followed the dedicated guide depending on your App type.**
Whatever the App you plan to develop, please have a look at the dedicated guide before moving forward in this one:
 - [Dam App](/guides/dam-connection/introduction.html)
 - [eCommerce App](/guides/ecommerce-connection/introduction.html)
 - [translation App](/guides/translation-connection/introduction.html)
 - [ERP App](/guides/erp-connection/introduction.html)
 - [syndication App](/guides/syndication-connection/introduction.html)
 - [print App](/guides/print-connection/introduction.html)

## How to follow this tutorial?

We recommend that you follow the steps in the proposed order and from the first to the last drop: you may store data that you will use later.
Nevertheless, if you are already familiar with our dear [API](https://api.akeneo.com/) and [PIM key concepts](https://help.akeneo.com/pim/serenity/themes-for-julia.html#first-steps), feel free to tackle this guide in the order you want.
Some steps are not mandatory for all e-commerce platforms â€” you wonâ€™t, for instance, synchronize assets or reference entities if you use a PIM community edition. We indicated them: skip these chapters if youâ€™re not concerned.
