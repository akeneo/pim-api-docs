# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome in this tutorial!

This tutorial will teach you:
> How to synchronize PIM product data with your App

## Goal
At the end of this tutorial and thanks to the REST API, all your product data from your PIM will be persisted in your App storage.

## Prerequisite

<i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> **You have access to a 6.0 or newer Akeneo PIM.**  
This can seem pretty obvious. But yeah! You will need a PIM if you want to make any REST API requests.
And of course, you also have to make sure that you can access it from where you are requesting.

<i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> **You have access to an App, and it has its own storage system.**
Whatever is the storage system, you will need one for product data persistence.
You don't know what an App is? Have a look to our documentation about this next way of connecting with Akeneo [here](/apps/introduction.html).

That's it! :tada:
