# _Step 3_ | Make the REST API request

Alright! You're all set now. Let's launch this request.

1. In Postman, in the `Collections` panel, click on `Your very first collection`.
2. Click on `The authentication request`.

3. Hit the blue `Send` button.
![Send authent request](/img/getting-started/send-authent-request.png)
In the response area, you should get an answer similar to the one below.

4. Now, click on `Your very first request` in the `Collections` tab.
5. You can see the request we are about to launch. It is using the endpoint referenced [here](/api-reference.html#get_products). We are going to ask your PIM to give us its first 100 products.

6. Are you ready? Hit the blue `Send` button.
In the response area, you can see a list of 100 products in json format.

:tada: **You've just did your first REST API call!**

::: info
The authentication token only lasts for one hour. This means that after one hour your token will expire. And you will receive an error message that looks like this.

Don't panic! You just have to send the `The authentication request` again and you'll be all good. :wink:
