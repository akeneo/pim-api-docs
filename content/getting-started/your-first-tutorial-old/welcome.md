# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome in this tutorial!

This tutorial will teach you:
> How to make your very first API request on a v1.7, v2 or v3 PIM

## Goal
This is the very first tutorial to follow. At the end, you will have:
- obtained your credentials to authenticate yourself with the API,
- received products from your PIM by using the API.

## Prerequisite

<i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> **You have access to a v1.7, v2 or v3 Akeneo PIM.**  
This can seem pretty obvious. But yeah! You will need a PIM if you want to make any API requests.  
And of course, you also have to make sure that you can access it from where you are requesting.
::: info
This tutorial is dedicated to version of the PIM older than the v4. If you are working on a v4 PIM, we also got you covered! :wink: There is a tutorial for you right [here](/getting-started/my-first-tutorial-4x/welcome.html).

That's it! :tada:
