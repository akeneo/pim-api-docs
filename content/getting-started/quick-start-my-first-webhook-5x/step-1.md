# _Step 1_ | Receive my first set of data

Here, you will connect an event subscription to a fake endpoint and receive your first data. :rocket:

## Create a Bin on Mockbin

[Mockbin](http://mockbin.org/) allows you to generate custom endpoints to test, mock, and track HTTP requests & responses between libraries, sockets and APIs.
Go to [mockbin.org/bin/create](http://mockbin.org/bin/create) to create your Bin and if needed change the configuration to respond with a 200 status.

![Create Bin on Mockbin](/img/getting-started/quick-start-my-first-webhook/create-mockbin.png)

Then click on `Create Bin` and go to the history of your Bin.
Alright! Mockbin is ready to receive our first piece of data from PIM webhooks.

## Send data to Mockbin
Now, log into your 5.0 or SaaS Akeneo PIM then go to the `Event subscriptions` page of the connection you created before.
Fill in the URL field with the URL of your bin and click on `Test`. 
_To access your connection settings, click on `Connect`, then on `Connection settings`._

::: warning
Don't forget to save your configuration before leaving the page.

You should see that the response of Mockbin is 200! :tada:

## Receive data on Mockbin

You are going to be amazed by the first piece of data you just received. Click on details and tada :tada:

Now you can play with the API and update a product to receive the event in your Bin! If you don't know how to run an API call follow this guide: [Your first tutorial](/getting-started/your-first-tutorial-4x/welcome.html).

::: tips
If you're in a SaaS or a Flexibility environment, your server is correctly configured by us. :rocket: So it must be a permission problem!  
If you are on an Enterprise Edition, you may want to take a look at your permissions. To do so, follow check out our [What is an event subscription?](https://help.akeneo.com/pim/serenity/articles/what-is-an-event-subscription.html) page to find out more about the configuration.  
If it's not a permission issue, you may want to make sure your server is able to send data. You can check by using a curl on the Bin URL from your server.    
In the details of your Mockbin Bin, you will find the curl command you need to run!
