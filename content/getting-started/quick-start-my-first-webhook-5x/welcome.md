# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to this tutorial!

This tutorial will teach you:
> How to connect a PIM event subscription to your own app

## Goal
This is the very first tutorial to follow. At the end, you will:
- be sure that the PIM is well configured to push data from PIM event subscriptions to your app. :mailbox_with_mail:
- display event subscriptions data in the console of a Symfony app. 

## Prerequisite

<i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> **You have access to a SaaS or a 5.0 Akeneo PIM.**  
This can seem pretty obvious. But yes, you will need a PIM if you want to make it work, and the webhook feature is only available on 5.0 or SaaS platforms!

<i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> **A well configured Connection.**  
To create a new connection, you can follow this tutorial [The connection creation](/getting-started/your-first-tutorial-4x/step-1.html).

<i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> **Event subscriptions are configured at your connection level.**  
Last, if your PIM is not already configured to send events, follow this documentation about [What is an event subscription?](https://help.akeneo.com/pim/serenity/articles/what-is-an-event-subscription.html).
It explains how to setup the PIM and the connection.

That's it! :tada:
