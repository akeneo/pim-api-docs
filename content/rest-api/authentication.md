# Authentication

:::warning
This documentation concerns `Connector` development only.

If you develop an `App` please consult this [documentation](/apps/authentication-and-authorization.html) instead.

Want to know the differences between an `App` and `Connector`? Please consult this [documentation](/apps/overview.html#why-apps-over-connectors).
:::

For security reasons, to access the REST API, you will need to be authenticated.
To authenticate your REST API calls, the PIM will provide you a pair of client ID and secret. [See here to discover how](#client-idsecret-generation).

Client IDs allow two things:
- to ask for a token for a specific API user,
- to refresh an expired token.

This means that you will also need to [create an API user](#api-user-creation) in order to get this token.

Once you get its username and password, together with the client ID and the secret, you will eventually be able to generate a token for the REST API. This is the _key_ to finally access the REST API. See [here for more details](#token-generation).

## Client ID/secret generation

Follow this process to generate your ‚ÄúClient ID/secret‚Äù:

1. Log into your favorite PIM.
1. Go to the `Connect/Connection settings` menu.
1. Click on `Create`.
1. Input a label for your connection, `ERP` for example.
1. Select a type flow. [_Don't know what it is? More info here._](https://help.akeneo.com/pim/articles/manage-your-connections.html#choose-your-flow-type)
1. Click on `Save`.

Congrats! You officially created your very first connection to the PIM. :tada:

You can now find the client ID and secret in the `Credentials` section of the connection you've just created.

::: info
In case your secret leaked, you can easily revoke it and generate a new one for your connection by clicking on the dedicated icon, on the right side of the secret.

## API user creation

You now have a client ID and a secret.  But the request to get this token needs a username and a password.

::: tips
**You don't know your PIM version?**  
You can find it in the `version` line of the `System/System information` page.  
If the version looks like a datetime, you use one of our SaaS offers, so please check the _Since the PIM v4_ paragraph.
::: 

### Since the PIM v4

Since the PIM v4, this username and password are automatically generated whenever you create a connection in the UI. Depending on the version you use, navigate to the `System/Connections` menu (before the v6) or the `Connect/Connection settings` menu, click on your connection and find your username and password in the `Credentials` section.

You may need to regenerate a password if you haven't saved it anywhere. Indeed, for security reasons, the PIM can only show it to you once, after the connection is created. There is a `Regenerate` button close to the hidden password if needed. :wink:

### With a v1.7, 2.x and 3.x PIM

In previous versions of the PIM, you need to navigate to the `System/Users` menu in your PIM UI and create a new user. We strongly advise you to create specific API users. Do not re-use UI users. üôÇ


## Token generation

You now have a client ID, a secret, a username and a password. The last information needed to use the REST API is the token.

First, you will have to encode the client ID and the secret, in base64, with a `:` in between.

```
client_id:secret

base64 encoded

```

To get a valid token, the client application must send the following request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://your-host/api/oauth/v1/token \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Basic YOUR_BASE_64_CLIENT_ID_AND_SECRET" \
    -d '{
        "grant_type": "password",
        "username": "your_API_username",
        "password": "its_password"
    }'
```

:::info
The content type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` is also supported.

:::warning
If you experience any error, please check the [troubleshooting guide](/documentation/troubleshooting.html#missing-client-id).
:::

#### Example

**Request**
```bash
curl -X POST http://my-favorite-pim.com/api/oauth/v1/token \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Basic NGdtNHJub2l6cDhnc2tna2swODBzc29vODAwNDBnNDRrc293d2d3ODQ0azQ0c2MwMHM6NWR5dm8xejZ5MzRzbzRvZ2tna3N3ODhvb2tvb3dzMDBjZ29jNDg4a2NzOHdrNGM0MHM=" \
    -d '{
        "grant_type": "password",
        "username": "myERPuser",
        "password": "64bngr78"
    }'
```

**Response**
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
    "access_token": "NzFiYTM4ZTEwMjcwZTcyZWIzZTA0NmY3NjE3MTIyMjM1Y2NlMmNlNWEyMTAzY2UzYmY0YWIxYmUzNTkyMDcyNQ",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "token_type": "bearer",
    "scope": null,
    "refresh_token": "MDk2ZmIwODBkYmE3YjNjZWQ4ZTk2NTk2N2JmNjkyZDQ4NzA3YzhiZDQzMjJjODI5MmQ4ZmYxZjlkZmU1ZDNkMQ"
}
```

Detail of the information given in the response:
- `access_token` must be included in every request to the REST API for the client application to be authorized (see the example below).
- `expires_in` is the token lifespan (in seconds). By default, it lasts 1 hour.
- `refresh_token` is a special token used only to refresh your `access_token` after it expired.


## Access a resource

Use the token that you just got for every request to the REST API.

#### Example

```bash
curl https://demo.akeneo.com/api/rest/v1/categories \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer NzFiYTM4ZTEwMjcwZTcyZWIzZTA0NmY3NjE3MTIyMjM1Y2NlMmNlNWEyMTAzY2UzYmY0YWIxYmUzNTkyMDcyNQ"
```

:::info
There are only 2 routes that do not require authentication:
 - the root of the REST API, that lists all the available endpoints. See [this section](/documentation/overview.html#list-of-available-endpoints) for more info.
 - and of course, the route to get tokens. Pretty logic, isn't it!
:::


## Refresh an expired token

For security reasons, access tokens have a certain lifespan. A client application using an expired token will be unable to request the REST API.

After a token has expired, the client application can ask for a new token by calling:

```bash
curl -X POST http://your-host/api/oauth/v1/token \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Basic YOUR_BASE_64_CLIENT_ID_AND_SECRET" \
    -d '{
        "refresh_token" : "REFRESH_TOKEN",
        "grant_type": "refresh_token"
    }'
```

#### Example

**Request**
```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://my-favorite-pim.com/api/oauth/v1/token' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Basic M18xc3duZzU0ZHY2ODB3MG84Z2N3Y3d3ODRzd2tvYzA0NG9jc2c0b2N3azRjYzAwY2swdzozc3VhaHhlODhsaWNvdzAwZzBvODBnY2NnZ2d3OGNza2c0d2NvOHdvb293dzQ4ODBzbw==' \
-d '{
    "refresh_token" : "OTI5MDE4ZjBiNjUyNWEyOTA5ZWQxNjE0ZDJiZTAzZTIwZjQ5ZDJmMDlhYzk4OTdjNzgzMTVkZDlmNTlmZjY3OQ",
    "grant_type": "refresh_token"
 }'
```

**Response**
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
  "access_token": "MjkxYjM0ZGU0OGQzN2MzNmRmOGFkMzgxODdhMDZiNmE1MTI2ZDJmYmM5MTBhZWFiMGY0ZjE3YzJhOTJkOGRlZA",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "scope": null,
  "refresh_token": "MTU2OWI5NGYwZTU2MThmMjE3MzRmYmIyMjlmYzU5Zjc3ZDhlM2E5YzQyMmIyMDVhOGY2OWQ3MTM0MTMzNmZlYw"
}
```

The response is the same as when asking for the initial token, except that it contains a new `access_token` and a new `refresh_token`. You can then use this `access_token` for every REST API request you do within an hour.

::: info
By default, the refresh token expiration is set at 1209600 seconds (14 days).
