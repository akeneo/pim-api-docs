# Response codes

_All the responses you can get when requesting via the REST API_

## Client errors

There are several types of errors when requesting via the REST API.

### 400 error
Sending malformed data results in a `400 Bad Request` response.

#### Example
```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request

{
    "code": 400,
    "message": "Invalid json message received"
}
```

As JSON format is expected in all POST and PATCH requests, you will get this error response when your JSON body is malformed.
For example, these are malformed JSON.

A comma is missing.
```json
{
    "code": "myproduct"
    "family": "myfamily"
}
```

There are missing quotes for the `code` property.
```json
{
    code: "myproduct",
    "family": "myfamily"
}
```

Below is the good format. Just perfect. Don't move a single comma. ;)
```json
{
    "code": "myproduct",
    "family": "myfamily"
}
```

### 401 error
Trying to access to the REST API without authentication results in a `401 Unauthorized` response.

#### Example
```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized

{
    "code": 401,
    "message": "Authentication is required"
}
```

#### Classical mistakes
The authorization header with the authentication token is missing.
```bash
curl https://demo.akeneo.com/api/rest/v1/categories
```

Try `Bearer` instead of `Basic` as a keyword before your authentication token.
```bash
curl https://demo.akeneo.com/api/rest/v1/categories \
    -H "Authorization: Basic NzFiYTM4ZTEwMjcwZTcyZWIzZTA0NmY3NjE3MTIyMjM1Y2NlMmNlNWEyMTAzY2UzYmY0YWIxYmUzNTkyMDcyNQ"
```

    "message": "Access forbidden. You are not allowed to administrate categories."

### 404 error
Trying to access to a non-existing resource results in a `404 Not Found` response.

#### Example
```http
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found

{
    "code": 404, 
    "message": "Category 'master' does not exist."
}
```

### 405 error
Trying to use a method on a route for which it is not implemented results in a `405 Method Not Allowed` response.

#### Example
```http
HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed

{
    "code": 405, 
    "message": "No route found for 'POST /api/rest/v1/products/myproduct': Method Not Allowed (Allow: GET, PATCH, DELETE)"
}
```

### 406 error
Trying to give the `Accept` header a value different from `application/json` when getting data, results in a `406 Not Acceptable` response.

#### Example
```http
HTTP/1.1 406 Not Acceptable

{
    "code": 406, 
    "message": "‘xxx’ in ‘Accept‘ header is not valid. Only ‘application/json‘ is allowed."
}
```

### 409 error
When a request could not be processed because of conflict, it results in a `409 Conflict` error.

#### Example
```http
HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict
```

### 415 error
Trying to give the `Content-type` header a value different from `application/json` when posting or patching data, results in a `415 Unsupported Media Type` response.

#### Example
```http
HTTP/1.1 415 Unsupported Media Type

{
  "code": 415,
  "message": "‘xxx’ in ‘Content-type’ header is not valid.  Only ‘application/json’ is allowed."
}
```

Forgetting to give the `Content-type` header when posting or patching data, also results in a `415 Unsupported Media Type` response.

#### Example
```http
HTTP/1.1 415 Unsupported Media Type

{
  "code": 415,
  "message":"The ‘Content-type’ header is missing. ‘application/json’ has to specified as value."
}
```

### 422 error
Sending invalid data results in a `422 Unprocessable Entity` response.

#### Example
```http
HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity

{
    "code": 422,
    "message": "Validation failed.",
    "errors": [
        {
            "property": "values",
            "message": "The tommh value is not in the brand attribute option list.",
            "attribute": "brand",
            "locale": null,
            "scope": null
        }
    ]
}
```

Sending unrecognized properties as well.

#### Example
```http
HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity

{
    "code": 422,
    "message": "Property 'extra_property' does not exist. Check the standard format documentation.",
    "_links": {
        "documentation": {
            "href": "https://docs.akeneo.com/master/reference/standard_format/other_entities.html#category"
        }
    }
}
```

Or, sending unknown data. 

#### Example
```http
HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity

{
    "code": 422,
    "message": "The sunglasses category does not exist in your PIM. Check the expected format on the API documentation.",
    "_links": {
        "documentation": {
            "href": "http://api.akeneo.com/api-reference.html#post_products"
        }
    }
}
```

### 429 error
Abusing the API will result in `429 Too Many Requests` response.
A Retry-After header is added to the response indicating the time to wait in seconds before retrying.

#### Example
```http
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Retry-After: 15
```

::: tips
When the REST API answers that something `does not exist`, it could also mean that the related user hasn't the permission to access it.
