# Resources

_A small presentation of each entity accessible through the API and their associated standard format_

For each resources, we defined a JSON standard format which is used to retrieve, create and update data in the PIM.

## Products

### Product

The product is the central entity of the PIM. This is the entity that holds all the information concerning products.

It can be classified in several categories. It can belong to a group and inherit its attributes from a family. It can hold associations with other products or group of products.

In other words, this really is the heart entity of the PIM.

In the Akeneo UI, in the 1.7 version, you can find the products in the `Enrich`/`Products` menu. In the 2.x version, it's below the `Products` menu.

Below is an example of a product in the UI.

#### Product values

Product values hold all the information of the product. In concrete terms, it is the values of the product attributes.

In the API, the product values are in the property `values` of the product entity.

A product value follows this format:
```json
{
  "values": {
    ATTRIBUTE_CODE: [
      {
        "locale": LOCALE_CODE,
        "scope": CHANNEL_CODE,
        "data": DATA_INFORMATION
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
In this formula:
 - `ATTRIBUTE_CODE` is the code of an attribute of the product,
 - `LOCALE_CODE` is the code of a locale when the attribute is localizable, should be equal to `null` otherwise,
 - `CHANNEL_CODE` is the code of a channel when the attribute is scopable, should be equal to `null` otherwise,
 - `DATA_INFORMATION` is the value stored for this attribute for this locale (if attribute is localizable) and this channel (if the attribute is scopable). Its type and format depend on the attribute type as you can see in the table below.

| Attribute type / Format| Example |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| **pim_catalog_identifier** <br> _string_ | `"12348716"` |
| **pim_catalog_text** <br> _string_ | `"Tshirt long sleeves"` |
| **pim_catalog_textarea** <br> _string_ | `"Tshirt long sleeves\nWinter special, 100% whool"` |
| **pim_catalog_file** <br> _string_ | `"f/2/e/6/f2e6674e076ad6fafa12012e8fd026acdc70f814_myFile.pdf"` |

| **pim_catalog_date** <br> _string, ISO-8601 format_ | `"2012-03-13T00:00:00+01:00"` |
| **pim_catalog_simpleselect** <br> _string_ | `"xs"` |
| **pim_catalog_reference_data_simpleselect** <br> _string_ | `"bouroullec"` |
| **pim_catalog_multiselect** <br> _Array[string]_ | `["leather", "cotton"]` |
| **pim_catalog_reference_data_multiselect** <br> _Array[string]_ | `["red", "black", "grey"]` |
| **pim_catalog_number** when `decimals_allowed` attribute property is set to `true` <br> _string_ | `"89.897"` |
| **pim_catalog_number** when `decimals_allowed` attribute property is set to `false` <br> _integer_ | `42` |
| **pim_catalog_boolean** <br> _boolean_ | `true` |
| **pim_catalog_metric** when `decimals_allowed` attribute property is set to `true` <br> _Object{"amount": string, "unit": string}_ | `{"amount":"-12.78","unit":"KILOWATT"}` |
| **pim_catalog_metric** when `decimals_allowed` attribute property is set to `false` <br> _Object{"amount": integer, "unit": string}_ | `{"amount":13,"unit":"KILOWATT"}` |
| **pim_catalog_price** when `decimals_allowed` attribute property is set to `true` <br> _Array[Object{"amount": string, "currency": string}]_ | `[{"amount":"45.00","currency":"USD"}, {"amount":"56.53","currency":"EUR"}]` |
| **pim_catalog_price** when `decimals_allowed` attribute property is set to `false` <br> _Array[Object{"amount": integer, "currency": string}]_ | `[{"amount":45,"currency":"USD"}, {"amount":56,"currency":"EUR"}]` |
| **pim_assets_collection** <br> _Array[string]_ <br><em>Deprecated - See <a href="/api-reference-index.html#PAM">here</a></em> | `["my_first_asset_code", "my_second_asset_code"]` |
| **akeneo_reference_entity**<br> Since the 3.0 only <br> _string_  | `"italy"` |
| **akeneo_reference_entity_collection**<br> Since the 3.0 only <br> _Array[string]_ | `["starck", "dixon"]` |

**Product values of a localizable attribute**

The `short_description` attribute is localizable but not scopable, so it can hold several data values, up to one for each locale.
```json
{
  "short_description": [
    {
      "locale": "en_US",
      "scope": null,
      "data": "Tshirt long sleeves"
    },
    {
      "locale": "fr_FR",
      "scope": null,
      "data": "Tshirt manches longues"
    }
  ]
}
```
:::info
Note that the `scope` property is set to `null` in this case.
:::

**Product values of a scopable attribute**

The `release_date` attribute is scopable but not localizable, so it can hold several data values, up to one for each channel.
```json
{
  "release_date": [
    {
      "locale": null,
      "scope": "ecommerce",
      "data": "2012-03-13T00:00:00+01:00"
    },
    {
      "locale": null,
      "scope": "mobile",
      "data": "2012-04-23T00:00:00+01:00"
    }
  ]
}
```
:::info
Note that the `locale` property is set to `null` in this case.
:::

**Product values of a localizable and scopable attribute**

The `description` attribute is both scopable and localizable, so it can hold several data values, up to one for each couple of channels and locales.
```json
{
  "description": [
    {
      "locale": "de_DE",
      "scope": "mobile",
      "data": "Akeneo Mug"
    },
    {
      "locale": "de_DE",
      "scope": "print",
      "data": "Akeneo Mug"
    },
    {
      "locale": "en_US",
      "scope": "mobile",
      "data": "Akeneo Mug"
    },
    {
      "locale": "en_US",
      "scope": "print",
      "data": "Akeneo Mug"
    },
    {
      "locale": "fr_FR",
      "scope": "mobile",
      "data": "Mug Akeneo"
    },
    {
      "locale": "fr_FR",
      "scope": "print",
      "data": "Mug Akeneo"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Product value of a non localizable, non scopable attribute**

The `main_color` attribute is neither scopable nor localizable, so it can hold only one data value.
```json
{
  "main_color": [
    {
      "locale": null,
      "scope": null,
      "data": "black"
    }
  ]
}
```
:::info
Note that the `locale` and `scope` properties are all set to `null` in this case.

### Product model (2.x only)

The product model gathers similar products that differ in some aspects, and allows the enrichment of their common properties.

It's like a product, but it's not a product! It can be categorized and it's composed of product values. For more information about what are the "product values", take a look to this dedicated piece of [documentation](/documentation/resources.html#product-values).

In the Akeneo UI, product models are displayed in the grid, exactly like classical products. To distinguish them from products, notice the small pile of pictures: it symbolizes the fact that a product model gathers several products with different variants.

![Product models in the grid](/img/rest-api/product_models_in_the_grid_ui.png)

It's also possible to enrich product model. Below, you can find a screenshot of what the UI looks like.

![Product models in the PEF](/img/rest-api/product_models_in_the_pef_ui.png)

To finish, below is the JSON standard format representing a product model. Notice how much it's closed to the product standard format!

```json
{
  "code": "jack",
  "family": "clothing",
  "family_variant": "clothing_color_size",

      }
    ],

### Published product (2.x and EE only)

A published product is a product that was published by a user in order to freeze a given version of the product. It can be very useful when you want to work on a new version of your product for the next collection for example, but in the meantime, you still want to export the previous version of your product to your channels.

::: warning
This is an Enterprise Edition feature. So you won't be able to call this endpoint if you are working on a Community Edition PIM. ;)
:::

In the Akeneo UI in v2.x, you can find the published products by clicking on the `...` button in the top right corner, when you are on the products grid. Then select the `Published products` option. You will then see a grid really similar to the classical product grid.

Below is the JSON standard format representing a published product. Notice how totally similar to the classical product format it is!

```json

### Product media file
A product media file can be an image (a photo, an illustration, etc.), a video (demonstration of a product, an animation, etc.), an audio file (music, podcast, etc.), other multimedia (PDF file) or office documents (.xlsx, .docx, .csv, etc.). It can also be any exotic format you could use.

It is used as the attribute value of a product, i.e. a product value.

In the Akeneo UI, you can find media files in the product form when they are associated to a media attribute.

## Catalog structure

### Category

A category is a way of classifying products. Categories constitute category trees and in Akeneo, you can have multiple category trees with an unlimited number of levels (categories, subcategories, subsubcategories..).

:::info
A product can be classified in one or n categories.
:::

In the Akeneo UI in v2.x, you can find the categories in the `Settings`/`Categories` menu. In the 1.7, you'll find it in the `Enrich`/`Categories` menu.

::: versions id="categories" 2.x![Categories in the Akeneo UI](/img/rest-api/categories_ui.png) 1.7![Categories in the Akeneo UI](/img/rest-api/v1.7/categories_ui.png)

}
```

### Attribute

An attribute is a characteristic of a product. Each product is composed of a variety of attributes.

Depending on your Akeneo Edition version, you can have up to 13 attribute types: text and text area, simple or multiselect, boolean (yes/no), date, image, price, number, metric, assets (digital resources like a video, picture, PDF file...).

An attribute can be localizable. It means that it can have different values for each locale. This allows you to manage translations of your products according to the activated PIM locales. For instance, a localizable attribute will enable you to have one article name for each locale activated in your PIM. It is mostly used for text or (simple or multi) select attributes.

Some attributes can be shown only for specific locales. We will call them locale specific. For instance, a cold resistance attribute only for Russia, a Canadian tax only for Canada.

Finally, an attribute can be scopable. An attribute is scopable if its values differ for each channel. For instance, you might have one short description for your e-commerce website, maybe one even shorter for your mobile app but a long one for your print catalog.

In the Akeneo UI, you can find the attributes in the `Settings`/`Attributes` menu. Below is an example of one attribute in the UI.

### Attribute option

Some type of attributes offers list of choices. These available choices are attribute options.

Only attribute of type simple select, multiselect, reference data simple select and reference data multiselect can have options.

In the Akeneo UI, you can find the attribute options in the `Settings`/`Attributes` menu, then select a simple or multiselect attribute and go to the `Values` tab in the attribute form. Below is an example of the attribute options of the attribute `camera_brand` in the UI.

### Family

A family is a set of attributes that are shared by products belonging to this family. In other words, a family can be considered as a template for products. A product family can use all of the attributes available in the PIM. Several families of products can use the same attributes. 

When a product is associated to a family, the product automatically inherits from all attributes defined at the family level. 

The family helps managing the product’s completeness as you can say at the family level, which family attributes are required for the completeness calculation.

::: info
A product can belong to only one family.

Nevertheless, a product does not have to belong to a family. In this case, it has no default attributes.
:::

In the Akeneo UI, you can find the families in the `Settings`/`Families` menu. Below is an example of a family in the UI.

### Family variant (2.x only)

The family variant is the entity used to modelize the products with variants.

From a single place, in a family variant, you will define all the structure for products with variants. You will define the number of variant levels, the variant axes and the distribution of attributes between common attributes or specific attributes for a variant.

In the Akeneo UI, you can find the family variants of one given family by going under the `Settings`/`Families` menu. Then, select one family and click on the `Variants` tab. All the variants of your family are right here!

### Attribute group (2.x only)

To facilitate the work of Julia inside the PIM, we gather attributes into groups. These groups are called `Attribute groups`.

In the Akeneo UI, you can find the attribute groups in the `Settings`/`Attribute groups` menu. Below is a screenshot of all attribute groups in the UI.

![Attribute groups in the Akeneo UI](/img/rest-api/attribute_groups_ui.png)

Below is the JSON standard format representing these attribute groups.

### Locale
A locale is a combination of a language (English, German, French...) and a country (United States, United Kingdom, France...). Examples: English UK (en_GB), English US (en_US), English AU (en_AU).

You can have one or more locales activated in your PIM.

In the Akeneo UI, you can find the locales in the `Settings`/`Locales` menu.

### Measure family (2.x only)
If you want to store metrics regarding your product such as weight, height or power inside your PIM, you will need measure families. These entities will be really helpful in the case you are requesting products for a given channel and you want these metrics attributes to be converted into the units you specified in your channel.

Below is an example of one of these metrics attributes.

## PAM _- Deprecated_

::: warning
With the introduction of our brand new way to handle assets, the Asset Manager, the PAM feature will be removed from the v4.0 of the PIM. As a result, **from now on, all the API resources regarding the PAM assets are deprecated**. They will not be available anymore starting from the v4.0. 
To understand why, we recommend you to read this [Medium post](https://medium.com/akeneo-labs/between-stability-and-innovation-c2d2dd61a804), we wrote on this special occasion.  
Also, don't hesitate to take a look at the [Asset Manager documentation](/documentation/asset-manager.html) to discover this new feature and how much more efficient it will be to handle your precious assets.
:::

### Asset (since 2.1 and EE only) _- Deprecated_

::: warning
This resource is **deprecated**. It means that it will be removed in the next PIM version, aka the 4.0. As a result, from now on, all the endpoints regarding this resource are deprecated. To understand why, we recommend you to read this [Medium post](https://medium.com/akeneo-labs/between-stability-and-innovation-c2d2dd61a804), we wrote on this special occasion.  
Also, did you know that since the 3.2, you can handle your assets thanks to the Asset Manager, the brand new efficient way to manage your product assets within the PIM.  
[Eager to know more about these new assets? It's right here!](/documentation/asset-manager.html#the-asset)
:::

An asset is the EE entity that allows to hold a file which can be an image, a video, a document... In the PIM, you can find all your assets in a library called PAM (Product Asset Manager). In this library, you can manage and classify your assets into their own categories, called [asset categories](/documentation/resources.html#asset-category-21-only).

Once you upload your asset into the PAM, you can then associate it to your products thanks to a specific attribute type, called `Asset collection`. This attribute allows you to select several assets in one single attribute.

An asset can be localizable, this way you can have a different file for each of your locales. The PIM can also automatically generates variations of your reference file for each of your channels. So neat!

::: warning
Do not confuse assets and media files. Those are totally different entities. The first one is only available in the EE, whereas the second is available in both CE & EE PIM.
The main difference is that the media files cannot be classified, they are not reusable among products and you can only have one media file per media attribute. 
Also, assets are really more powerful, you can automatically generate variations of your file depending on your channel.
:::

In the Akeneo UI in v2.x, you can find the PAM, where all the assets are stored, in the `Assets` menu. Below is a screenshot of the PAM.

## Reference entities

### Reference entity (3.x and EE only)

Reference entities have been introduced in the PIM in the 3.0 version. Note that they are a EE feature, so they are not available in the Community Edition.

Reference entities are objects that are related to products but have their own attributes and lifecycle. A reference entity can be for example the brands, the ranges, the manufacturers, the colors, the materials or the care instructions... And so many other entities.

In the Akeneo UI, you can find the reference entities in the `Entities` menu. Below is an example of the `Brand` reference entity with its [records](/documentation/resources.html#reference-entity-record-3x-and-ee-only) in the UI.

![Reference entity](/img/rest-api/v3.0/reference_entity.png)

Reference entities have attributes that allow to describe their [records](/documentation/resources.html#reference-entity-record-3x-and-ee-only).

::: warning
Note that the "Reference entity attribute" resource is not the same as the "Attribute" resource, even though they have a lot in common. The first one is used to describe reference entities records, the second one is use to describe products.
:::

In the Akeneo UI, you can find the attributes that compose a given reference entity by following these simple steps. Go in the `Entities` menu. Click on a reference entity and then, click on the `Attributes` sub menu. Below is an example of the attributes that compose the `Designer` entity in the UI.

### Reference entity attribute option (3.x and EE only)

Some type of attributes of reference entities can offer a list of choices. These available choices are reference entity attribute options.

::: warning
Note that the "Reference entity attribute option" resource is not the same as the "Attribute option" resource, even though they have a lot in common. The first one is an option of an attribute used to describe reference entities records, the second one is an option of an attribute used to describe products.
:::

Only attribute of type `single option` or `multiple options` can have options.

In the Akeneo UI, if you want to manage the options of an reference entity attribute with single and multiple options, first, select a reference entity in the `Entities` menu. Then, click on the `Attributes` sub-menu. Click on the edit button of a single or multiple options attribute. An edit popin should open. Then, click on the `Manage options` button. Here you are! You can view and edit the options of your attribute.  

The screenshot below shows the screen where you can manage your options.

You can have at max 100 options per attribute. If you want to have more, it makes totally sense to create a new reference entity that you can then use as an attribute.  
As a consequence of this limit, when you ask for the list of attribute options of one given attribute, you'll see that the response is not paginated. It won't cause any performance issue, since you can't have more than 100 options per attribute.

### Reference entity record (3.x and EE only)

Reference entities have been introduced in the PIM in the 3.0 version.

A record holds all the information of a reference entity. A record can be related to one or more products.

Let's give an example to be clearer. For the "Brand" reference entity, a record could be all the information regarding the "Kartell" brand.

In the Akeneo UI, you can find the reference entity records in the `Entities` menu by selecting one of the entity of your choice. Below is an example of the record of a reference entity in the UI.

#### Reference entity record values

Reference entity record values hold all the information of a reference entity record. In concrete terms, it is the values of the attributes you will find in the record of a reference entity.

In the API, the reference entity record values are in the property `values` of the reference entity record.

Reference entity record values follow the same format as [product values](/documentation/resources.html#product-values): 
```json
{
  "values": {
    ATTRIBUTE_CODE: [
      {
        "locale": LOCALE_CODE,
        "channel": CHANNEL_CODE,
        "data": DATA_INFORMATION
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
In this formula:
 - `ATTRIBUTE_CODE` is the code of an attribute of the reference entity record,
 - `LOCALE_CODE` is the code of a locale when the attribute is localizable, should be equal to `null` otherwise,
 - `CHANNEL_CODE` is the code of a channel when the attribute is scopable, should be equal to `null` otherwise,
 - `DATA_INFORMATION` is the value stored for this attribute for this locale (if attribute is localizable) and this channel (if the attribute is scopable). Its type and format depend on the attribute type as you can see in the table below.

| Attribute type / Format| Example |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| **Text** <br> _string_ | `"A well-known manufacturer of high-end furniture"` |
| **Image** <br> _string_ | `"5/1/d/8/51d81dc778ba1501a8f998f3ab5797569f3b9e25_img.png"` |
| **Number** <br> _string_ | `"1949"` |
| **Simple select** <br> _string_ | `"yellow"` |
| **Multi select** <br> _Array[string]_ | `["leather", "cotton"]` |
| **Reference entity simple select** <br> _string_ | `"italy"` |
| **Reference entity multi select** <br> _Array[string]_ | `["starck", "dixon"]` |

**Reference entity record values of a localizable attribute**

The `short_description` attribute is localizable but not scopable, so it can hold several data values, up to one for each locale.
```json
{
  "short_description": [
    {
      "locale": "en_US",
      "channel": null,
      "data": "A well-known manufacturer of high-end furniture"
    },
    {
      "locale": "fr_FR",
      "channel": null,
      "data": "Un fabricant renommé de meubles de qualité"
    }
  ]
}
```
:::info
Note that the `channel` property is set to `null` in this case.
:::

**Reference entity record values of a scopable attribute**

The `image` attribute is scopable but not localizable, so it can hold several data values, up to one for each channel.
```json
{
  "image": [
    {
      "locale": null,
      "channel": "ecommerce",
      "data": "5/1/d/8/51d81dc778ba1501a8f998f3ab5797569f3b9e25_img_ecommerce.png"
    },
    {
      "locale": null,
      "channel": "mobile",
      "data": "c/4/d/8/51d81dc778ba1501a8f998f3ab57975610g7867i_img_mobile.png"
    }
  ]
}
```
:::info
Note that the `locale` property is set to `null` in this case.
:::

**Reference entity record values of a localizable and scopable attribute**

The `description` attribute is both scopable and localizable, so it can hold several data values, up to one for each couple of channels and locales.
```js
{
  "description": [
    {
      "locale": "en_US",
      "channel": "mobile",
      "data": "Calligaris is a well-known manufacturer of high-end furniture that was founded in Italy in 1923."
    },
    {
      "locale": "en_US",
      "channel": "ecommerce",
      "data": "Calligaris is an Italian manufacturer of high-end furniture. It was founded in 1923 in Italy in the small town of Manzano. Its creator is Antonio Calligaris, a craftman specialized in the creation of wood chairs."
    },
    {
      "locale": "fr_FR",
      "channel": "mobile",
      "data": "Calligaris est un fabricant de meubles renommé qui fut fondé en 1923 en Italie."
    },
    {
      "locale": "fr_FR",
      "channel": "ecommerce",
      "data": "Calligaris est un fabricant italien de meubles de luxe. L'entreprise a été fondé en 1923 en Italie dans la petite ville de Manzano. Son créateur, Antonio Calligaris, était un artisan spécialisé dans la fabrication de chaises en bois."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Reference entity record value of a non localizable, non scopable attribute**

The `creation_year` attribute is neither scopable nor localizable, so it can hold only one data value.
```json
{
  "creation_year": [
    {
      "locale": null,
      "channel": null,
      "data": "1949"
    }
  ]
}
```
:::info
Note that the `locale` and `channel` properties are all set to `null` in this case.

### Reference entity media file (3.x and EE only)

Reference entity media files corresponds to the images that you can link to the records of your reference entities and also, to the images that you can direclty link to your reference entities.

In the Akeneo UI, you can find these media files in the detail of a record. In the screenshot below, there are two record media files: 
- the first image with the logo of the brand,
- the second image inside the `Photo` attribute.
