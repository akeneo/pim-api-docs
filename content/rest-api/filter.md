# Filters

When requesting a list of resources via the REST API, you can apply filters to get only the ones you want.

## Filter on product properties

To filter products by one of its properties, you can use the `search` query parameter. The value given to this query parameter should be a valid JSON as shown below.

```
/api/rest/v1/products-uuid?search={PRODUCT_PROPERTY:[{"operator":OPERATOR,"value":VALUE}]}
```

In the above url :

- `PRODUCT_PROPERTY` can be any property detailed in the sections below,
- `OPERATOR` is an allowed operator for this `PRODUCT_PROPERTY`,
- `VALUE` is a value whose type corresponds to the allowed type detailed below.

#### Examples

To only retrieve enabled products, you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/products-uuid?search={"enabled":[{"operator":"=","value":true}]}
```

Of course, you can combine as many filters as you want. The example below will get you the enabled products being 70% complete.

```
/api/rest/v1/products-uuid?search={"enabled":[{"operator":"=","value":true}],"completeness":[{"operator":">","value":70,"scope":"ecommerce"}]}
```

You can even combine several filters on the same product properties. The example below will get you the products categorized on the Winter Collection category and that are not categorized on the Accessories category.

```
/api/rest/v1/products-uuid?search={"categories":[{"operator":"IN","value":["winter_collection"]},{"operator":"NOT IN","value":["accessories"]}]}
```

To get the product models that are not in the `camcorders` and `digital_cameras` family, you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/product-models?search={"family":[{"operator":"NOT IN","value":["camcorders","digital_cameras"]}]}
```

### On creation or update date

::: availability versions=2.3,3.x,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=CE,EE

To filter product models on creation or update date, use the product property `created` and `updated`, respectively.
Here are the allowed operators to filter on these properties as well as the corresponding type of value expected in the `search` query parameter.

::: info
Please note that dates are interpreted in the time zone of the server that runs Akeneo (e.g. date.timezone setting in php.ini). For SaaS clients, please note that the time zone of the server is in UTC as this is the most precise and commonly referred to time standard.

|

#### Examples

To get the product models that were created on the 4th of July 2016 at 10am, you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/product-models?search={"created":[{"operator":"=","value":"2016-07-04 10:00:00"}]}
```

To get the product models that were updated during the last 4 days, you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/product-models?search={"updated":[{"operator":"SINCE LAST N DAYS","value":4}]}
```

### On their parent

::: availability versions=6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=CE,EE

To filter product models on their parent, use the `parent` product model property.
Here are the allowed operators you can use to filter by parent as well as the corresponding type of value expected in the `search` query parameter.

| Operator    | Allowed value type                 | Filter description                                                     |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `IN`        | array of valid product model codes | Returns sub product model children of the provided root product models |
| `EMPTY`     | no value                           | Only returns root product models                                       |
| `NOT EMPTY` | no value                           | Only returns sub product models                                        |

#### Examples

To get all the sub-product models of the root product model with the code `tshirt_armor`, you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/product-models?search={"parent":[{"operator":"IN","value":["tshirt_armor"]}]}
```

To get all the root product models, you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/product-models?search={"parent":[{"operator":"EMPTY"}]}
```

To get all the sub-product models, you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/product-models?search={"parent":[{"operator":"NOT EMPTY"}]}
```

## Filter on product values

::: availability versions=1.7,2.x,3.x,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=CE,EE

To filter products, and product models **since the v2.3**, on its [product values](/concepts/products.html#focus-on-the-product-values), you can use the `search` query parameter when requesting products. The value given to this query parameter should be a valid JSON as shown below.

```
/api/rest/v1/products-uuid?search={ATTRIBUTE_CODE:[{"operator":OPERATOR,"value":VALUE,"locale":LOCALE_CODE,"scope":CHANNEL_CODE}]}
```

In the above url :

- `ATTRIBUTE_CODE` can be any existing attribute code,
- `OPERATOR` is an allowed operator for the attribute type of the `ATTRIBUTE_CODE` attribute,
- `VALUE` is a value whose type corresponds to the attribute type of the `ATTRIBUTE_CODE` attribute,
- `LOCALE_CODE` is an existing locale code that should be only given when the `ATTRIBUTE_CODE` attribute is localizable
- `CHANNEL_CODE` is an existing channel code that should be only given when the `ATTRIBUTE_CODE` attribute is scopable.

#### Examples

To get products that are purple, purple being an option of the simple select `main_color` attribute and this attribute being neither localizable nor scopable, you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/products-uuid?search={"main_color":[{"operator":"IN","value":["purple"]}]}
```

To get products having a description begining with `Amazing` on the `en_US` locale, the `short_description` attribute being localizable but not scopable, you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/products-uuid?search={"short_description":[{"operator":"STARTS WITH","value":"Amazing","locale":"en_US"}]}
```

To get products that have a release date due after the 4th of July 2016 for the `ecommerce` channel, the `release_date` attribute being scopable but not localizable, you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/products-uuid?search={"release_date":[{"operator":">","value":"2016-07-04","scope":"ecommerce"}]}
```

To get products that have a name that contains with `shirt` on the `en_US` locale for the `mobile` channel, the `name` attribute being both localizable and scopable, you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/products-uuid?search={"name":[{"operator":"CONTAINS","value":"shirt","locale":"en_US","scope":"mobile"}]}
```

Of course, you can combine as many filters as you want. The example below will get you the products with description starting with `Amazing` on the `en_US` locale for the `ecommerce` channel, and of purple color.

```
/api/rest/v1/products-uuid?search={"description":[{"operator":"STARTS WITH","value":"Amazing","locale":"en_US","scope":"ecommerce"}],"main_color":[{"operator":"IN","value":["purple"]}]}
```

You can even combine several filters on the same attribute. The example below will get you the products with not empty description on the `en_US` locale and empty description on the `fr_FR` locale for the `ecommerce` channel.

```
/api/rest/v1/products-uuid?search={"description":[{"operator":"NOT EMPTY","locale":"en_US","scope":"ecommerce"},{"operator":"EMPTY","locale":"fr_FR","scope":"ecommerce"}]}
```

:::info
Filtering on product values is also available for published products.
:::

### `search_locale` query parameter

::: availability versions=1.7,2.x,3.x,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=CE,EE
If you need to filter on several attributes on the same locale, you can use the `search_locale` query parameter, to avoid repeating yourself for each attribute. This parameter expect an existing locale code.

#### Example

```
/api/rest/v1/products-uuid?search={"description":[{"operator":"STARTS WITH","value":"Amazing","locale":"en_US","scope":"ecommerce"}],"short_description":[{"operator":"CONTAINS","value":"shoes","locale":"en_US","scope":"ecommerce"}]}

is equivalent to

/api/rest/v1/products-uuid?search={"description":[{"operator":"STARTS WITH","value":"Amazing","scope":"ecommerce"}],"short_description":[{"operator":"CONTAINS","value":"shoes","scope":"ecommerce"}]}&search_locale=en_US
```

:::info
This query parameter is also available for the published products.
:::

### `search_scope` query parameter

::: availability versions=1.7,2.x,3.x,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=CE,EE
If you need to filter on several attributes on the same channel, you can use the `search_scope` query parameter, to avoid repeating yourself for each attribute. This parameter expect an existing channel code.

#### Example

```
/api/rest/v1/products-uuid?search={"release_date":[{"operator":">","value":"2016-07-04","scope":"ecommerce"}],"short_description":[{"operator":"CONTAINS","value":"shoes","locale":"en_US","scope":"ecommerce"}]}

is equivalent to

/api/rest/v1/products-uuid?search={"release_date":[{"operator":">","value":"2016-07-04"}],"short_description":[{"operator":"CONTAINS","value":"shoes","locale":"en_US"}]}&search_scope=ecommerce
```

:::info
This query parameter is also available for the published products.

## Filter product values

Thanks to the above sections, you are able to filter your products to only get those you want. In this section, you will see that you also can filter the product values to only receive those you want.

:::info
Filtering product values via attributes, channel or locale is also available for published products.
:::

### Via attributes

::: availability versions=1.7,2.x,3.x,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=CE,EE

If you want to receive for each product only product values about specific attributes, you can specify it thanks to the `attributes` query parameter.

#### Example

To get products with only product values regarding the `description` attribute, you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/products-uuid?attributes=description
```

You can filter product values on several attributes at the same time.

```
/api/rest/v1/products-uuid?attributes=name,description
```

### Via locale

::: availability versions=1.7,2.x,3.x,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=CE,EE

If you want to receive for each product only product values on specific locales, as well as the product values of the non localizable attributes, you can specify it thanks to the `locales` query parameter.

#### Example 1

Imagine that without this filter you get these product values:

```json
{
  "color": [
    {
      "data": "carmine_red",
      "locale": null,
      "scope": null
    }
  ],
  "name": [
    {
      "data": "Top",
      "locale": "en_US",
      "scope": null
    },
    {
      "data": "Débardeur",
      "locale": "fr_FR",
      "scope": null
    }
  ],
  "description": [
    {
      "data": "Summer top",
      "locale": "en_US",
      "scope": "ecommerce"
    },
    {
      "data": "Top",
      "locale": "en_US",
      "scope": "tablet"
    },
    {
      "data": "Débardeur pour l'été",
      "locale": "fr_FR",
      "scope": "ecommerce"
    },
    {
      "data": "Débardeur",
      "locale": "fr_FR",
      "scope": "tablet"
    }
  ]
}
```

To get only product values regarding the `en_US` locale (+ the product values of the non localizable attributes), you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/products-uuid?locales=en_US
```

As a result you will receive the following answer:

```json
{
  "color": [
    {
      "data": "carmine_red",
      "locale": null,
      "scope": null
    }
  ],
  "name": [
    {
      "data": "Top",
      "locale": "en_US",
      "scope": null
    }
  ],
  "description": [
    {
      "data": "Summer top",
      "locale": "en_US",
      "scope": "ecommerce"
    },
    {
      "data": "Top",
      "locale": "en_US",
      "scope": "tablet"
    }
  ]
}
```

::: warning
As you can see, for the simple select attribute named `color`, as the attribute is not localizable (the `locale` field is set to `null`), the product value of this attribute is not filtered and you still get the code of the attribute option, `carmine_red`.
If you want to get the localized label of this attribute option, you will have to request the [attribute option endpoint](/api-reference.html#get_attributes__attribute_code__options__code_).
:::

#### Example 2

You can also filter product values on several locales at the same time.

```
/api/rest/v1/products-uuid?locales=en_US,fr_FR
```

### Via channel

::: availability versions=1.7,2.x,3.x,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=CE,EE

There is also a `scope` query parameter that will allow you to:

- get only the selection of products that are in the tree linked to the channel you specified,
- get only the product values for this specific channel, as well as the product values of the non scopable attributes.

#### Example

To get products from the tree linked to the `ecommerce` channel with only product values regarding the `ecommerce` channel (+ the product values of the non scopable attributes), you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/products-uuid?scope=ecommerce
```

:::warning
Note that you cannot use this filter on several channels.
:::

:::info
When using this query parameter, you will never be able to retrieve products that are not categorized. This is due to the fact that we only return the selection of products that are in the tree linked to the given channel. In other words, if a given product is not categorized in this tree, you won't receive it.
:::

## Filter on published product properties

To filter published products by one of their properties, you can use the `search` query parameter. The value given to this query parameter should be a valid JSON as shown below.

```
/api/rest/v1/published-products?search={PUBLISHED_PRODUCT_PROPERTY:[{"operator":OPERATOR,"value":VALUE}]}
```

In the above url :

- `PUBLISHED_PRODUCT_PROPERTY` can be any property detailed in the sections below,
- `OPERATOR` is an allowed operator for this `PUBLISHED_PRODUCT_PROPERTY`,
- `VALUE` is a value whose type corresponds to the allowed type detailed below.

#### Examples

To only retrieve enabled published products, you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/published-products?search={"enabled":[{"operator":"=","value":true}]}
```

Of course, you can combine as many filters as you want. The example below will get you the enabled published products being 70% complete.

```
/api/rest/v1/published-products?search={"enabled":[{"operator":"=","value":true}],"completeness":[{"operator":">","value":70,"scope":"ecommerce"}]}
```

You can even combine several filters on the same published product properties. The example below will get you the published products created both the 4th and the 5th of July 2016.

```
/api/rest/v1/published-products?search={"created":[{"operator":"=","value":"2016-07-04 10:00:00"},{"operator":"=","value":"2016-07-05 10:00:00"}]}
```

### On their categories

::: availability versions=1.7,2.x,3.x,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=CE,EE

To filter published products on their categories, use the property `categories`.
Here are the allowed operators you can use to filter on the category code as well as the corresponding type of value expected in the `search` query parameter.

| Operator             | Allowed value type                  | Filter description                                                                                                |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `IN`                 | an array of existing category codes | Only returns the published products that are in the given categories                                              |
| `NOT IN`             | an array of existing category codes | Only returns the published products that are not in the given categories                                          |
| `IN OR UNCLASSIFIED` | an array of existing category codes | Only returns the published products that are in the given categories or that are not classified in any categories |
| `IN CHILDREN`        | an array of existing category codes | Only returns the published products that are in the children of the given categories                              |
| `NOT IN CHILDREN`    | an array of existing category codes | Only returns the published products that are not in the children of the given categories                          |
| `UNCLASSIFIED`       | no value                            | Only returns the published products that are not classified into any category                                     |

#### Example

To get the published products of the `winter_collection` category, you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/published-products?search={"categories":[{"operator":"IN","value":["winter_collection"]}]}
```

### On their status

::: availability versions=5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=CE,EE

To filter published products on their status, use the `enabled` property.
Here are the allowed operators you can use to filter on the status as well as the corresponding type of value expected in the `search` query parameter.

| Operator | Allowed value type | Filter description                                                              |
| -------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `=`      | boolean            | Only returns published products that are enabled (`true`) or disabled (`false`) |
| `!=`     | boolean            | Only returns published products that are enabled (`false`) or disabled (`true`) |

#### Example

To get the disabled published products, you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/published-products?search={"enabled":[{"operator":"=","value":false}]}
```

### On their completeness

::: availability versions=1.7,2.x,3.x,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=CE,EE

To filter published products on their completeness, use the `completeness` published product property. You will also need to provide a `scope` value to specify on which channel you want to filter with the completeness.
Here are the allowed operators you can use to filter by completeness as well as the corresponding type of value expected in the `search` query parameter.

| Operator                                                                 | Allowed value type | Filter description                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<` or `<=`                                                              | integer            | Only returns published products that have a completeness lower than (or equal to) the given value on the given channel independently of locales.                             |
| `>` or `>=`                                                              | integer            | Only returns published products that have a completeness greater than (or equal to) the given value on the given channel independently of locales.                           |
| `=`                                                                      | integer            | Only returns published products that have completeness equal to the given value on the given channel independently of locales.                                               |
| `!=`                                                                     | integer            | Only returns published products that have a completeness different from the given value on the given channel independently of locales.                                       |
| `GREATER THAN ON ALL LOCALES` or `GREATER OR EQUALS THAN ON ALL LOCALES` | integer            | Only returns published products that have a completeness on all locales that is greater than (or equal to) the given value on the given channel for the given set of locales |
| `LOWER THAN ON ALL LOCALES` or `LOWER OR EQUALS THAN ON ALL LOCALES`     | integer            | Only returns published products that have a completeness on all locales that is lower than (or equal to) the given value on the given channel for the given set of locales   |

#### Examples

To get the published products that are 100% complete for the `ecommerce` channel, you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/published-products?search={"completeness":[{"operator":"=","value":100,"scope":"ecommerce"}]}
```

To get the published products that are 100% complete on both the `en_US` and `fr_FR` locales for the `ecommerce` channel, you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/published-products?search={"completeness":[{"operator":"GREATER OR EQUALS THAN ON ALL LOCALES","value":100,"locales":["en_US","fr_FR"],"scope":"ecommerce"}]}
```

### On their group or family

::: availability versions=1.7,2.x,3.x,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=CE,EE

To filter published products on groups or families, use respectively the published product property `groups` and `family`.
Here are the allowed operators you can use to filter on these properties as well as the corresponding type of value expected in the `search` query parameter.

| Operator    | Allowed value type                | Filter description                                                                        |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `IN`        | array of existing group or family | Only returns published products that are respectively in the given families or groups     |
| `NOT IN`    | array of existing group or family | Only returns published products that are respectively not in the given families or groups |
| `EMPTY`     | no value                          | Only returns published products that have respectively no groups or no family             |
| `NOT EMPTY` | no value                          | Only returns published products that have respectively a group or a family                |

#### Examples

To get the published products that are in the `promotion` group, you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/published-products?search={"groups":[{"operator":"IN","value":["promotion"]}]}
```

To get the published products that are not in the `camcorders` and `digital_cameras` family, you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/published-products?search={"family":[{"operator":"NOT IN","value":["camcorders","digital_cameras"]}]}
```

### On their creation or update date

::: availability versions=1.7,2.x,3.x,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=CE,EE

To filter published products on creation or update date, use respectively the published product property `created` and `updated`.
Here are the allowed operators to filter on these properties as well as the corresponding type of value expected in the `search` query parameter.

::: info
Please note that dates are interpreted in the time zone of the server that runs Akeneo (e.g. date.timezone setting in php.ini). For SaaS clients, please note that the time zone of the server is in UTC as this is the most precise and commonly referred to time standard.

|

#### Examples

To get the published products that were created on the 4th of July 2016 at 10am, you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/published-products?search={"created":[{"operator":"=","value":"2016-07-04 10:00:00"}]}
```

To get the published products that were updated during the last 4 days, you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/published-products?search={"updated":[{"operator":"SINCE LAST N DAYS","value":4}]}
```

## Filter on published product values

::: availability versions=1.7,2.x,3.x,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=CE,EE

To filter published products, and product models **since the v2.3**, on its [product values](/concepts/products.html#focus-on-the-product-values), you can use the `search` query parameter when requesting products. The value given to this query parameter should be a valid JSON as shown below.

```
/api/rest/v1/published-products?search={ATTRIBUTE_CODE:[{"operator":OPERATOR,"value":VALUE,"locale":LOCALE_CODE,"scope":CHANNEL_CODE}]}
```

In the above url :

- `ATTRIBUTE_CODE` can be any existing attribute code,
- `OPERATOR` is an allowed operator for the attribute type of the `ATTRIBUTE_CODE` attribute,
- `VALUE` is a value whose type corresponds to the attribute type of the `ATTRIBUTE_CODE` attribute,
- `LOCALE_CODE` is an existing locale code that should be only given when the `ATTRIBUTE_CODE` attribute is localizable
- `CHANNEL_CODE` is an existing channel code that should be only given when the `ATTRIBUTE_CODE` attribute is scopable.

#### Examples

To get published products that are purple, purple being an option of the simple select `main_color` attribute and this attribute being neither localizable nor scopable, you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/published-products?search={"main_color":[{"operator":"IN","value":["purple"]}]}
```

To get published products having a description begining with `Amazing` on the `en_US` locale, the `short_description` attribute being localizable but not scopable, you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/published-products?search={"short_description":[{"operator":"STARTS WITH","value":"Amazing","locale":"en_US"}]}
```

To get published products that have a release date due after the 4th of July 2016 for the `ecommerce` channel, the `release_date` attribute being scopable but not localizable, you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/published-products?search={"release_date":[{"operator":">","value":"2016-07-04","scope":"ecommerce"}]}
```

To get published products that have a name that contains with `shirt` on the `en_US` locale for the `mobile` channel, the `name` attribute being both localizable and scopable, you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/published-products?search={"name":[{"operator":"CONTAINS","value":"shirt","locale":"en_US","scope":"mobile"}]}
```

Of course, you can combine as many filters as you want. The example below will get you the published products with description starting with `Amazing` on the `en_US` locale for the `ecommerce` channel, and of purple color.

```
/api/rest/v1/published-products?search={"description":[{"operator":"STARTS WITH","value":"Amazing","locale":"en_US","scope":"ecommerce"}],"main_color":[{"operator":"IN","value":["purple"]}]}
```

You can even combine several filters on the same attribute. The example below will get you the published products with not empty description on the `en_US` locale and empty description on the `fr_FR` locale for the `ecommerce` channel.

```
/api/rest/v1/published-products?search={"description":[{"operator":"NOT EMPTY","locale":"en_US","scope":"ecommerce"},{"operator":"EMPTY","locale":"fr_FR","scope":"ecommerce"}]}
```

### `search_locale` query parameter

::: availability versions=1.7,2.x,3.x,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=CE,EE
If you need to filter on several attributes on the same locale, you can use the `search_locale` query parameter, to avoid repeating yourself for each attribute. This parameter expect an existing locale code.

#### Example

```
/api/rest/v1/published-products?search={"description":[{"operator":"STARTS WITH","value":"Amazing","locale":"en_US","scope":"ecommerce"}],"short_description":[{"operator":"CONTAINS","value":"shoes","locale":"en_US","scope":"ecommerce"}]}

is equivalent to

/api/rest/v1/published-products?search={"description":[{"operator":"STARTS WITH","value":"Amazing","scope":"ecommerce"}],"short_description":[{"operator":"CONTAINS","value":"shoes","scope":"ecommerce"}]}&search_locale=en_US
```

### `search_scope` query parameter

::: availability versions=1.7,2.x,3.x,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=CE,EE
If you need to filter on several attributes on the same channel, you can use the `search_scope` query parameter, to avoid repeating yourself for each attribute. This parameter expect an existing channel code.

#### Example

```
/api/rest/v1/published-products?search={"release_date":[{"operator":">","value":"2016-07-04","scope":"ecommerce"}],"short_description":[{"operator":"CONTAINS","value":"shoes","locale":"en_US","scope":"ecommerce"}]}

is equivalent to

/api/rest/v1/published-products?search={"release_date":[{"operator":">","value":"2016-07-04"}],"short_description":[{"operator":"CONTAINS","value":"shoes","locale":"en_US"}]}&search_scope=ecommerce
```

### Available operators

## Filter published product values

Thanks to the above sections, you are able to filter your published products to only get those you want. In this section, you will see that you also can filter the published product values to only receive those you want.

### Via attributes

::: availability versions=1.7,2.x,3.x,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=CE,EE

If you want to receive for each published product only published product values about specific attributes, you can specify it thanks to the `attributes` query parameter.

#### Example

To get published products with only published product values regarding the `description` attribute, you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/published-products?attributes=description
```

You can filter published product values on several attributes at the same time.

```
/api/rest/v1/published-products?attributes=name,description
```

### Via locale

::: availability versions=1.7,2.x,3.x,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=CE,EE

If you want to receive for each product only product values on specific locales, as well as the product values of the non localizable attributes, you can specify it thanks to the `locales` query parameter.

#### Example 1

Imagine that without this filter you get these product values:

```json
{
  "color": [
    {
      "data": "carmine_red",
      "locale": null,
      "scope": null
    }
  ],
  "name": [
    {
      "data": "Top",
      "locale": "en_US",
      "scope": null
    },
    {
      "data": "Débardeur",
      "locale": "fr_FR",
      "scope": null
    }
  ],
  "description": [
    {
      "data": "Summer top",
      "locale": "en_US",
      "scope": "ecommerce"
    },
    {
      "data": "Top",
      "locale": "en_US",
      "scope": "tablet"
    },
    {
      "data": "Débardeur pour l'été",
      "locale": "fr_FR",
      "scope": "ecommerce"
    },
    {
      "data": "Débardeur",
      "locale": "fr_FR",
      "scope": "tablet"
    }
  ]
}
```

To get only product values regarding the `en_US` locale (+ the product values of the non localizable attributes), you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/published-products?locales=en_US
```

As a result you will receive the following answer:

```json
{
  "color": [
    {
      "data": "carmine_red",
      "locale": null,
      "scope": null
    }
  ],
  "name": [
    {
      "data": "Top",
      "locale": "en_US",
      "scope": null
    }
  ],
  "description": [
    {
      "data": "Summer top",
      "locale": "en_US",
      "scope": "ecommerce"
    },
    {
      "data": "Top",
      "locale": "en_US",
      "scope": "tablet"
    }
  ]
}
```

::: warning
As you can see, for the simple select attribute named `color`, as the attribute is not localizable (the `locale` field is set to `null`), the product value of this attribute is not filtered and you still get the code of the attribute option, `carmine_red`.
If you want to get the localized label of this attribute option, you will have to request the [attribute option endpoint](/api-reference.html#get_attributes__attribute_code__options__code_).
:::

#### Example 2

You can also filter product values on several locales at the same time.

```
/api/rest/v1/published-products?locales=en_US,fr_FR
```

### Via channel

::: availability versions=1.7,2.x,3.x,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=CE,EE

There is also a `scope` query parameter that will allow you to:

- get only the selection of products that are in the tree linked to the channel you specified,
- get only the product values for this specific channel, as well as the product values of the non scopable attributes.

#### Example

To get published products from the tree linked to the `ecommerce` channel with only product values regarding the `ecommerce` channel (+ the product values of the non-scopable attributes), you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/published-products?scope=ecommerce
```

:::warning
Note that you cannot use this filter on several channels.
:::

:::info
When using this query parameter, you will never be able to retrieve published products that are not categorized. This is due to the fact that we only return the selection of products that are in the tree linked to the given channel. In other words, if a given product is not categorized in this tree, you won't receive it.
:::

## Filter locales

::: availability versions=1.7,2.x,3.x,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=CE,EE

When requesting locales, you can use a filter to get the enabled ones.

#### Example

```
/api/rest/v1/locales?search={"enabled":[{"operator":"=","value":true}]}
```

## Filter reference entity records

### By record codes

::: availability versions=7.0,SaaS editions=EE

You can filter the reference entity records by their code.

Below is the operator to filter on this property, as well as the corresponding type of value expected in the `search` query parameter.

| Operator | Allowed value type                 | Filter description                        |
|----------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `IN`     | an array of existing record codes  | Only returns records that are in the list |

#### Example

```
/api/rest/v1/reference-entities/brands/records?search={"code":[{"operator":"IN","value":["code1","code2"]}]}
```


### By completeness

::: availability versions=3.x,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=EE

You can filter the reference entity records to get only the completed ones on a given channel for given locales.

#### Example

```
/api/rest/v1/reference-entities/brands/records?search={"complete":{"operator":"=","value":true,"channel":"ecommerce","locales":["en_US"]}}
```

### By update date

::: availability versions=3.x,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=EE

You can filter the reference entity records by their update date.

Below are the allowed operators to filter on this property, as well as the corresponding type of value expected in the `search` query parameter.

::: info
Please note that you have to write dates in either of these format _2021-05-17T15:19:32Z_, or _2021-05-17T15:19:32+00:00_ according to the [ISO 8601 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).

Moreover dates are interpreted in the time zone of the server that runs Akeneo (e.g. date.timezone setting in php.ini). For SaaS clients, please note that the time zone of the server is in UTC as this is the most precise and commonly referred to time standard.

#### Example

To get the reference entity records that were updated since the 4th of July 2016 at 10am (UTC), you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/reference-entities/brands/records?search={"updated":[{"operator":">","value":"2018-07-04T10:00:00+00:00"}]}
```

### Record values by locale

::: availability versions=3.x,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=EE

If you want to receive reference entity records of one given reference entity with only the attribute values of specific locales, as well as the attribute values of the non localizable attributes, you can specify it thanks to the `locales` query parameter.

#### Example 1

Imagine that without this filter you get these attribute values:

```json
{
  "description": [
    {
      "locale": "en_US",
      "channel": "mobile",
      "data": "Calligaris is a well-known manufacturer of high-end furniture that was founded in Italy in 1923."
    },
    {
      "locale": "en_US",
      "channel": "ecommerce",
      "data": "Calligaris is an Italian manufacturer of high-end furniture. It was founded in 1923 in Italy in the small town of Manzano. Its creator is Antonio Calligaris, a craftman specialized in the creation of wood chairs."
    },
    {
      "locale": "fr_FR",
      "channel": "mobile",
      "data": "Calligaris est un fabricant de meuble renommée qui fut fondé en 1923 en Italie."
    },
    {
      "locale": "fr_FR",
      "channel": "ecommerce",
      "data": "Calligaris est un fabricant italien de meubles de luxe. L'entreprise a été fondé en 1923 en Italie dans la petite ville de Manzano. Son créateur, Antonio Calligaris, était un artisan spécialisé dans la fabrication de chaises en bois."
    }
  ],
  "creation_year": [
    {
      "locale": null,
      "channel": null,
      "data": "1923"
    }
  ]
}
```

To get only the attribute values regarding the `en_US` locale (+ the attribute values of the non localizable attributes), you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/reference-entities/brands/records?locales=en_US
```

As a result you will receive the following answer:

```json
{
  "description": [
    {
      "locale": "en_US",
      "channel": "mobile",
      "data": "Calligaris is a well-known manufacturer of high-end furniture that was founded in Italy in 1923."
    },
    {
      "locale": "en_US",
      "channel": "ecommerce",
      "data": "Calligaris is an Italian manufacturer of high-end furniture. It was founded in 1923 in Italy in the small town of Manzano. Its creator is Antonio Calligaris, a craftman specialized in the creation of wood chairs."
    }
  ],
  "creation_year": [
    {
      "locale": null,
      "channel": null,
      "data": "1923"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Example 2

You can also filter attribute values on several locales at the same time.

```
/api/rest/v1/reference-entities/brands/records?locales=en_US,fr_FR
```

### Record values by channel

::: availability versions=3.x,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=EE

There is also a `channel` query parameter that will allow you to get only the attribute values for a specific channel, as well as the attribute values of the non scopable attributes.

:::warning
Note that you cannot use this filter on several channels.
:::

#### Example

Imagine that without this filter you get these attribute values:

```json
{
  "description": [
    {
      "locale": "en_US",
      "channel": "mobile",
      "data": "Calligaris is a well-known manufacturer of high-end furniture that was founded in Italy in 1923."
    },
    {
      "locale": "en_US",
      "channel": "ecommerce",
      "data": "Calligaris is an Italian manufacturer of high-end furniture. It was founded in 1923 in Italy in the small town of Manzano. Its creator is Antonio Calligaris, a craftman specialized in the creation of wood chairs."
    },
    {
      "locale": "fr_FR",
      "channel": "mobile",
      "data": "Calligaris est un fabricant de meuble renommée qui fut fondé en 1923 en Italie."
    },
    {
      "locale": "fr_FR",
      "channel": "ecommerce",
      "data": "Calligaris est un fabricant italien de meubles de luxe. L'entreprise a été fondé en 1923 en Italie dans la petite ville de Manzano. Son créateur, Antonio Calligaris, était un artisan spécialisé dans la fabrication de chaises en bois."
    }
  ],
  "creation_year": [
    {
      "locale": null,
      "channel": null,
      "data": "1923"
    }
  ]
}
```

To get only the attribute values regarding the `ecommerce` channel (+ the attribute values of the non scopable attributes), you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/reference-entities/brands/records?channel=ecommerce
```

As a result you will receive the following answer:

```json
{
  "description": [
    {
      "locale": "en_US",
      "channel": "ecommerce",
      "data": "Calligaris is an Italian manufacturer of high-end furniture. It was founded in 1923 in Italy in the small town of Manzano. Its creator is Antonio Calligaris, a craftman specialized in the creation of wood chairs."
    },

      "channel": "ecommerce",
      "data": "Calligaris est un fabricant italien de meubles de luxe. L'entreprise a été fondé en 1923 en Italie dans la petite ville de Manzano. Son créateur, Antonio Calligaris, était un artisan spécialisé dans la fabrication de chaises en bois."
    }
  ],
  "creation_year": [
    {
      "locale": null,
      "channel": null,
      "data": "1923"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Filter assets

When requesting a [list of assets via the REST API](/api-reference.html#get_assets), you can apply filters to get only the ones you want and also the kind of information you want in them.

### By asset codes

::: availability versions=7.0,SaaS editions=EE

You can filter the assets by their code.

Below is the operator to filter on this property, as well as the corresponding type of value expected in the `search` query parameter.

| Operator | Allowed value type               | Filter description                       |
|----------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `IN`     | an array of existing asset codes | Only returns assets that are in the list |

#### Example

```
/api/rest/v1/asset-families/model_pictures/assets?search={"code":[{"operator":"IN","value":["code1","code2"]}]}
```

### By update date

You can filter the assets by their update date.

Below is the operator to filter on this property, as well as the corresponding type of value expected in the `search` query parameter.

::: info
Please note that you have to write dates in either of these format _2021-05-17T15:19:32Z_, or _2021-05-17T15:19:32+00:00_ according to the [ISO 8601 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).

Moreover dates are interpreted in the time zone of the server that runs Akeneo (e.g. date.timezone setting in php.ini). For SaaS clients, please note that the time zone of the server is in UTC as this is the most precise and commonly referred to time standard.

| `<`                 | datetime <br> _Format: ISO 8601_           | Only returns assets that were <br> updated before the given day and hour                   |
| `BETWEEN`           | array of datetimes <br> _Format: ISO 8601_ | Only returns assets that were <br> updated between the two given dates                     |
| `NOT BETWEEN`       | array of datetimes <br> _Format: ISO 8601_ | Only returns assets that were <br> not updated between the two given dates                 |
| `SINCE LAST N DAYS` | integer                                    | Only returns assets that were <br> updated during the last n days, n being the given value |

#### Example

To get the assets that were updated since the 4th of July 2018 at 10am (UTC), you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/asset-families/model_pictures/assets?search={"updated":[{"operator":">","value":"2018-07-04T10:00:00Z"}]}
```

You can also combine operators.

```
/api/rest/v1/asset-families/model_pictures/assets?search={"updated":[{"operator":">","value":"2018-07-04T10:00:00Z"},{"operator":"<","value":"2018-08-04T10:00:00Z"}]}
```

To get the assets that were updated over a period of time, you can use the `BETWEEN` and `NOT BETWEEN` operators.

```
/api/rest/v1/asset-families/model_pictures/assets?search={"updated":[{"operator":"NOT BETWEEN","value":["2018-07-04T10:00:00Z","2018-08-04T10:00:00Z"]}]}
```

Finally, if you want to get the assets updated in the last 4 days, you can use the `SINCE LAST N DAYS` operator.

```
/api/rest/v1/asset-families/model_pictures/assets?search={"updated":[{"operator":"SINCE LAST N DAYS","value":4}]}
```

### Asset values by locale

::: availability versions=3.2,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=EE

If you want to receive assets with only the asset values of specific locales, as well as the attribute values of the non localizable attributes, you can specify it thanks to the `locales` query parameter.

#### Example 1

Imagine that without this filter you get these asset values:

```json
{
  "warning_mention": [
    {
      "locale": "en_US",
      "channel": "mobile",
      "data": "Photo retouched."
    },
    {
      "locale": "en_US",
      "channel": "ecommerce",
      "data": "Photo retouched. This does not necessarily reflect the reality."
    },
    {
      "locale": "fr_FR",
      "channel": "mobile",
      "data": "Photo retouchée."
    },
    {
      "locale": "fr_FR",
      "channel": "ecommerce",
      "data": "Photo retouchée, ne représentant pas forcément la réalité."
    }
  ],
  "model_is_wearing_size": [
    {
      "locale": null,
      "channel": null,
      "data": "small"
    }
  ]
}
```

To get only the asset values regarding the `en_US` locale (+ the attribute values of the non localizable attributes), you can use the following URL.

```
/api/rest/v1/asset-families/model_pictures/assets?locales=en_US
```

As a result you will receive the following answer:

```json
{
  "warning_mention": [
    {
      "locale": "en_US",
      "channel": "mobile",
      "data": "Photo retouched."
    },
    {
      "locale": "en_US",
      "channel": "ecommerce",
      "data": "Photo retouched. This does not necessarily reflect the reality."
    }
  ],
  "model_is_wearing_size": [
    {
      "locale": null,
      "channel": null,
      "data": "small"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Example 2

You can also filter asset values on several locales at the same time.

```
/api/rest/v1/asset-families/model_pictures/assets?locales=en_US,fr_FR
```

### Asset values by channel

      "channel": "mobile",
      "data": "Photo retouched."
    },
    {
      "locale": "en_US",
      "channel": "ecommerce",
      "data": "Photo retouched. This does not necessarily reflect the reality."

    {
      "locale": "fr_FR",
      "channel": "ecommerce",
      "data": "Photo retouchée, ne représentant pas forcément la réalité."
    }
  ],
  "model_is_wearing_size": [
    {
      "locale": null,
      "channel": null,
      "data": "small"
    }

}
```

To get only the attribute values regarding the `ecommerce` channel (+ the attribute values of the non scopable attributes), you can use the following URL.
