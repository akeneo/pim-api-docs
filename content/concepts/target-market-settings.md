# Target market settings

Product information enriched in the PIM is meant to be distributed over your channels. Otherwise gathering so much information into one single source of truth would be quite useless, right? :wink:

Target market settings are here to specify those distribution channels. You can interact with these entities through the following resources.  
Each section below contains an explanation of the concept behind these resources. You will find out more about their usage in the PIM and their JSON format in order for them to interact with the API. 

## Locale
A locale is a combination of a language (English, German, French...) and a country (United States, United Kingdom, France...). Examples: English UK (en_GB), English US (en_US), English AU (en_AU).

You can have one or more locales activated in your PIM.

In the Akeneo UI, you can find the locales in the `Settings`/`Locales` menu.

Below is the JSON standard format representing this set of locales.

```json

## Channel
A channel refers to a place where your product information will be visible: for example, a website, a print catalog or a mobile application.
Actually, a channel defines a selection of products and information to export.

:::info
A channel is also known as a «scope» in the Akeneo PIM.
:::

In the Akeneo UI, you can find them in the `Settings`/`Channels` menu.

## Currency _(v2+)_
If you want to store price information inside your PIM, you will need currencies.

In the Akeneo UI, you can find the currencies in the `Settings`/`Currencies` menu. Below is a screenshot of all currencies in the UI.

## Measure family _(v2+)_
If you want to store metrics regarding your product such as weight, height or power inside your PIM, you will need measure families. These entities will be really helpful in the case you are requesting products for a given channel and you want these metrics attributes to be converted into the units you specified in your channel.

Below is an example of one of these metrics attributes.

Below is the JSON standard format representing a measure family.

```json
{
   "code":"AREA",
   "standard":"SQUARE_METER",
   "units":[
     {
       "code":  "ACRE",
       "convert": {"mul": 4046.856422},
       "symbol": "A",
     },{
        "code":  "ARE",
        "convert": {"mul":  100},
        "symbol": "a"
      },...
   ]
}
```
