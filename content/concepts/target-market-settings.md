# Target market settings

Product information enriched in the PIM is meant to be distributed across your channels. Otherwise gathering so much information into one single source of truth would be quite useless, right? :wink:

Target market settings are here to specify those distribution channels. You can interact with these entities through the following resources.  
Each section below contains an explanation of the concept behind these resources. You will find out more about their usage in the PIM and their JSON format in order for them to interact with the REST API.

## Locale
::: availability versions=1.7,2.x,3.x,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=CE,EE
:::

A locale is a combination of a language (English, German, French...) and a country (United States, United Kingdom, France...). Examples: English UK (en_GB), English US (en_US), English AU (en_AU).

You can have one or more locales activated in your PIM.

In the Akeneo UI, you can find the locales in the `Settings`/`Locales` menu.

:::

Below is the JSON standard format representing this set of locales.

```json

}
```
```json

## Channel
::: availability versions=1.7,2.x,3.x,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=CE,EE
:::

A channel is a place where your product information is visible: for example, a website, a print catalog or a mobile application.
Actually, a channel defines a selection of products and information to export.

:::info
A channel is also known as a «scope» in the Akeneo PIM.
:::

In the Akeneo UI, you can find them in the `Settings`/`Channels` menu.

::: version-screenshots id="channels" 2.x![Channels in the Akeneo UI](/img/concepts/channels_ui.png) 1.7![Channels in the Akeneo UI](/img/concepts/v1.7/channels_ui.png)

Below is the JSON standard format representing this set of channels when requested through the REST API.

## Currency
::: availability versions=2.x,3.x,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=CE,EE
:::

If you want to store price information inside your PIM, you will need currencies.

In the Akeneo UI, you can find the currencies in the `Settings`/`Currencies` menu. Below is a screenshot of all currencies in the UI.

Below is the JSON standard format representing a currency.

```json
{
  "code":"EUR",
  "enabled":true
}
```

::: warning
Endpoints for the currencies are only available starting the 2.0 version.

## Measure family
::: availability versions=2.x,3.x,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=CE,EE
:::

::: warning
If you use a SaaS platform, we encourage you to use [these new endpoints](#measurement-family), as they are more powerful. They allow you to create/update measurement families and they guarantee the order of the conversion operations.
:::

If you want to store metrics regarding your product such as weight, height or power inside your PIM, you will need measure families. These entities will be really helpful in the case you are requesting products for a given channel and you want these metrics attributes to be converted into the units you specified in your channel.

Below is an example of one of the metrics attributes.

![Metrics attribute](/img/concepts/metrics_attributes_ui.png)

Below is the JSON standard format representing a measure family.

```json
{
   "code":"AREA",
   "standard":"SQUARE_METER",
   "units":[
     {
       "code":  "ACRE",
       "convert": {"mul": "4046.856422"},
       "symbol": "A"
     },{
        "code":  "ARE",
        "convert": {"mul":  "100"},
        "symbol": "a"

## Measurement family
::: availability versions=5.0,6.0,7.0,SaaS editions=CE,EE
:::

If you want to store your product measurement, i.e. weight, height or power inside your PIM, you will need measurement families. These entities will be really helpful when you are requesting products for a given channel and you want these measurement attributes to be converted into the units you set in the given channel.

Below is an example of one of these measurement attributes.

![Metrics attribute](/img/concepts/metrics_attributes_ui.png)

Below is the JSON standard format representing a measurement family.

```json
{
  "code": "AREA",
  "labels": {
    "en_US": "Area",
    "fr_FR": "Surface"
  },
  "standard_unit_code": "SQUARE_METER",
  "units": {
    "SQUARE_MILLIMETER": {
      "code": "SQUARE_MILLIMETER",
      "labels": {
        "en_US": "Square millimeter",
        "fr_FR": "Millimètre carré"
      },
      "convert_from_standard": [
        {
          "operator": "mul",
          "value": "0.000001"
        }
      ],
      "symbol": "mm²"
    },
    "SQUARE_CENTIMETER": {

      },
      "convert_from_standard": [
        {
          "operator": "mul",
          "value": "0.0001"
        }
      ],
      "symbol": "cm²"
    },
    "SQUARE_METER": {
      "code": "SQUARE_METER",
      "labels": {
        "en_US": "Square meter",

      },
      "convert_from_standard": [
        {
          "operator": "mul",
          "value": "1"
        }
      ],
      "symbol": "m²"
    },
    ...
  }
}
```
::: info
You can have at max 100 measurements families and 50 units per measurement family.  
As a consequence, when you ask for the list of measurement families with their units, you'll see that the response is not paginated. It won't cause any performance issue, since you can't have more than 100 measurement families.

### Focus on the units

For each measurement family, a unit is defined as standard and used to convert the other units using one or several conversion operations.

Each unit follows the same format:
```json
{
  "code": "UNIT_CODE",
  "labels": {
    "en_US": "UNIT_LABEL_EN_US",
    "fr_FR": "UNIT_LABEL_FR_FR"
  },
  "convert_from_standard": [
    {
      "operator": "CONVERSION_OPERATOR",
      "value": "CONVERSION_VALUE"
    }
  ],
  "symbol": "UNIT_SYMBOL"
}
```

In this formula:
- `UNIT_CODE` is the code to identify a unit.
- `UNIT_LABEL_EN_US` and `UNIT_LABEL_FR_FR` are the labels of a unit in each locale.
- `CONVERSION_OPERATOR` is the operator for a conversion operation to convert a unit from the standard unit.
- `CONVERSION_VALUE` is the value for a conversion operation to convert the unit from the standard unit.
- `UNIT_SYMBOL` is the symbol of the unit.

The conversion operators are:
- `add` for Add
- `sub` for Substract
- `mul` for Multiply
- `div` for Divide

::: info
One conversion operation per unit is required and you can have a maximum of 5 conversion operations per unit.
:::

If you have several conversion operations, the order of the conversion operations is important. For example, to convert the Fahrenheit unit in the standard unit Kelvin, you need to define 3 conversion operations:
1. Subtract 32
2. Divide by 1.8
3. Add 273.15


#### Examples
**With 1 conversion operation for the standard unit**
```json
{
  "code": "KELVIN",
  "labels": {
    "en_US": "Kelvin",
    "fr_FR": "Kelvin"
  },
  "convert_from_standard": [
    {
      "operator": "mul",
      "value": "1"
    }
  ],
  "symbol": "°K"
}
```


**With 1 conversion operation for a non-standard unit**
```json
{
  "code": "CELSIUS",
  "labels": {
    "en_US": "Celsius",
    "fr_FR": "Celsius"
  },
  "convert_from_standard": [
    {
      "operator": "add",
      "value": "273.15"
    }
  ],
  "symbol": "°C"
}
```

**With 3 conversion operations for a non-standard unit**
```json
{
  "code": "FAHRENHEIT",
  "labels": {
    "en_US": "Fahrenheit",
    "fr_FR": "Fahrenheit"
  },
  "convert_from_standard": [
    {
      "operator": "sub",
      "value": "32"
    },
    {
      "operator": "div",
      "value": "1.8"
    },
    {
      "operator": "add",
      "value": "273.15"
    }
  ],
  "symbol": "°F"
}
```
