# Filtering UI extensions

You may want to create UI extensions that are only available to certain user groups or for specific products. This can be achieved by filtering UI extensions based on user groups and product selection.

### Filter UI extension by user groups

You can filter the user groups allowed to see and execute an UI extension by using the permissions tab on the UI extensions creation/edition form.
