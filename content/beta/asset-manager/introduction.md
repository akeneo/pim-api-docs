# Introduction
The Asset Manager is a brand new and more efficient way to manage the assets linked to your products/product models inside the PIM. :rocket:

::: warning
This feature is only available in the Enterprise Edition.
:::

The assets of the Asset Manager will be way more powerful than before. They will benefit from 3 major new features:
- the possibility to define a flexible structure, thanks to the [asset families](#the-asset-family),
- the possibility to automatize the link with your products, thanks to the [product link rules](#focus-on-the-product-link-rule),
- the possibility to refer to both external and internal binaries, thanks to the [media link](#the-media-link-attribute), the [image](#the-image-attribute) and the [file](#coming-soon-the-file-attribute) attribute types. 

Below, you'll find an illustration of this wonderful new feature.

::: info
This new API is available starting in the 3.2 version of the PIM.
