# MCP Capabilities

When you interact with the Akeneo MCP Server through natural language (for example with Claude, Cursor, or VS Code), your AI assistant automatically calls **MCP Tools** behind the scenes.

These tools represent the "capabilities" of the Akeneo MCP Server â€” for instance:

- `get_products` - Retrieve one or multiple products
- `get_families` - List product families
- `get_attributes` - List attributes with filtering options
- `upsert_products` - Update or create several products
- And more...

Your LLM interprets your intent (e.g. *"Show me all disabled products"*) and dynamically selects and fills the right tool parameters (e.g. calling `get_products` with `enabled=false`).

## List & Debug The MCP Capabilities

If you want to **see, explore, or debug these tools directly**, there are a few options:

### MCP Inspector

[MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) is an open-source web app created by the Model Context Protocol team. It lets you **connect to any MCP server**, visualize its declared tools, schemas, prompts, and resources, and even **manually trigger tool calls.**

**How to use it:**

1. Go to [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector)
2. Connect to the Akeneo MCP Server at `https://server.mcp.akeneo.cloud/mcp`
3. Add your Akeneo credentials as headers:
   - `X-Akeneo-API-URL`: Your PIM URL
   - `X-Akeneo-Client-ID`: Your client ID
   - `X-Akeneo-Client-Secret`: Your client secret
   - `X-Akeneo-Username`: Your username
   - `X-Akeneo-Password`: Your password
4. Browse available tools and test them directly

### Postman

Postman now includes built-in support for MCP requests. You can directly query an MCP server, list its tools, and call them using the Postman interface.

**How to use it:**

1. In Postman, create a new **"MCP"** Collection
2. Set the server URL to `https://server.mcp.akeneo.cloud/mcp`
3. Add headers (optional if you just want to list the tools):
   ```json
   X-Akeneo-API-URL: "https://your-pim.akeneo.com"
   X-Akeneo-Client-ID: "your_client_id"
   X-Akeneo-Client-Secret: "your_client_secret"
   X-Akeneo-Username: "your_username"
   X-Akeneo-Password: "your_password"
   ```
4. Click **"Run"** to see the full list of capabilities
5. Select a tool (e.g. `get_products`) and test it directly

## Understanding Tool Responses

When you call MCP tools directly, the response is wrapped in a standard MCP structure:

- **structuredContent**: Structured JSON payload with tool-specific data
  - Example for `get_products`: a `product` object and `endpoint_used`
  - For search tools, you may also see `parameters_used`
- **content[]**: Raw, textual representation of the same data (for LLM rendering)
- **isError**: Boolean indicating whether the tool call failed

This mirrors what your LLM receives when handling your request, providing full visibility into the MCP server behavior.
