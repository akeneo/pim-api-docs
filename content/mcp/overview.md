# MCP Overview

**Connect your Akeneo PIM to AI-powered tools**

The Akeneo MCP Server is a bridge between your Akeneo PIM instance and AI tools that support the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It lets you interact with your product catalog using natural language—search products, update attributes, check compliance, and more—all without leaving your IDE or AI assistant.

## What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard for connecting AI assistants to data sources and tools. It enables AI models to interact with external systems in a structured and secure way.
