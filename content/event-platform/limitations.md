# Are there any quotas or limits?


**Event Platform Limits:**

- Up to 20 subscribers per PIM instance
- Up to 20 subscriptions per subscriber

**Event Platform Quotas:**

Our event platform does not impose specific quotas.

However, to ensure optimal performance and fair use for all users, heavy usage (millions of events per day) may require further discussion to help you optimise your usage.
