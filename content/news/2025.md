## November 2025

### <span class="label label-news label-added">ADDED</span> Our Postman collection is now based on the OpenAPI specification!

We are excited to announce that our Postman collection is now automatically generated from our `OpenAPI 3.1 specification`. This means you can now test and explore the Akeneo PIM API directly in Postman with up-to-date endpoints, parameters, and examples.

The collection includes all available API endpoints with pre-configured request examples, query parameters, and detailed descriptions to help you get started quickly.

Download the [Postman collection](/files/akeneo-postman-collection.json) and don't forget to also download the [environment template](/files/akeneo-postman-environment.json) to configure your API credentials!

## October 2025

### <span class="label label-news label-added">ADDED</span> Our new API reference based on the OpenAPI specification is live!

We are excited to announce the release of the new API reference documentation based on our `OpenAPI 3.1 specification`.

This allows developers to be up-to-date in real time on improvements made to the PIM.
This new documentation only applies to the SaaS version of the Akeneo REST API.

The [old documentation](/api-reference-paas-index.html) remains available for customers running the PaaS and community versions.

👉 See the [new API reference documentation](/api-reference-index.html)!

This new version is available in both **YAML** and **JSON** formats. It introduces significant improvements while ensuring compatibility with industry standards. You can now consult it to enhance your integrations.
