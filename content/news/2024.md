## April 2024

### <span class="label label-news label-added">ADDED</span> Official launch of the PIM GraphQL API

Great news for developers: Our official `GraphQL Outbound API` **is up and running**, ready for seamless integration into your projects!

Enjoy effortless data querying, real-time updates, and a more intuitive interaction with your PIM. 

👉 Dive in now by exploring the [documentation](/graphql/getting-started.html) !

### <span class="label label-news label-added">ADDED</span> Retrieve attributes types on product get

In order to enhance the user experience with our external API, we've incorporated two additional pieces of information into the response:
attribute_type: Indicates the attribute type for each product value.
reference_data_name: Identifies the code of the asset collection or the reference entity associated with this attribute.
This update is significant because previously, our clients had to:
Make a GET request for the product.
Make a GET request for the attribute to obtain the attribute type for each value.
Make a GET request for the reference entity or the asset to obtain the asset code or reference entity.
Now, they simply require a single GET request for the product, reducing the number of API calls needed and increasing productivity.
