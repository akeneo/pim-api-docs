### <span class="label label-news label-added">ADDED</span> Mapping for Apps using catalogs

Using the Catalog feature, you provide your users with a way to create a product selection quickly. 
And now, with the mapping schema, you send all information the PIM needs to display a mapping UI to your users. 

Thanks to the mapping configuration, the PIM flats products to send them in the right structure to your app, 
so you don't need to know the entire Akeneo PIM structure anymore to get product data
