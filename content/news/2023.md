## November 2023

### <span class="label label-news label-added">ADDED</span> Apply data transformation using Catalogs for Apps

*Please note this feature has no impact on the API.* 

These new capabilities help you provide a complete data mapping experience to your app users through the Akeneo PIM. 
Using the Mapping Catalog feature, your app users can now apply Akeneo functions to transform their PIM data to match your app requirements.  

👉 Learn more about [how to apply data transformation on your PIM data](https://help.akeneo.com/serenity-connect-your-pim/how-to-configure-catalogs-for-apps#transformation) and discover the [Akeneo function list](https://help.akeneo.com/serenity-connect-your-pim/akeneo-function-list)


## October 2023

### <span class="label label-news label-deprecated">FEATURE DEPRECATION</span> Published products

**On February 28, 2024, the Published products feature will be removed from Akeneo PIM. Therefore all related API capabilities will be deleted.**  

If you use the Published products API endpoints, you need to use the Product API instead to get the list of your products and activate them on your activation channels. **We strongly advise you to adapt existing integrations as soon as possible.**

## July 2023

### <span class="label label-news label-added">ADDED</span> Sample Apps with DSM Usage Example

Accelerate your front-end development process easily, without having to start everything from scratch.
This new sample app use case serves as a practical demonstration of how to effectively use the [Akeneo DSM](https://dsm.akeneo.com/) (Design System Manager) to integrate PIM components graphically.

## April 2023

### <span class="label label-news label-updated">UPDATED</span> Openid protocol is added to Akeneo Sample Apps

Bootstrap a draft App in no time with our example that integrates now the OpenID protocol so that you won’t have to code anything to be able to authenticate users coming from an Akeneo PXM Studio.

## March 2023

### <span class="label label-news label-added">ADDED</span> Custom Apps

With Custom apps, we're introducing a SaaS-compliant way to have a one size fits one scenario.  
When you don't find an on-the-shelf App answering your exact need on the Akeneo App Store, Custom apps allow you to develop your own app and benefit from all app features without publishing it. 

👉 Learn more about [custom apps](/apps/overview.html#develop-an-app-for-a-custom-need) 


### <span class="label label-news label-added">ADDED</span> Mapping for Apps using catalogs

Using the Catalog feature, you provide your users with a way to create a product selection quickly. 
And now, with the mapping schema, you send all information the PIM needs to display a mapping UI to your users. 

Thanks to the mapping configuration, the PIM flats products to send them in the right structure to your app, 
so you don't need to know the entire Akeneo PIM structure anymore to get product data


👉 Learn more about [how to use the mapping for apps](/apps/catalogs.html#use-the-catalog-product-mapping) 


### <span class="label label-news label-added">ADDED</span> Enriched categories

Creating a great customer experience means providing additional context at every step of their buying journey.  
Therefore Enriched Categories will give Akeneo customers the ability to enrich not just products, but categories as well, including channel- and locale-specific attributes too. 

On API side, you can find:
- a new option `with_enriched_attributes` on the [GET List of categories](/api-reference.html#get_categories) and the [GET a category](/api-reference.html#get_categories__code_) endpoints
- a new [endpoint to download a category media file](/api-reference.html#get_category_media_files__file_path__download) 

👉 Learn more about [enriched categories on our Help center](https://help.akeneo.com/pim/serenity/articles/enrich-your-category.html)
