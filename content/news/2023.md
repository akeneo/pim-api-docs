### <span class="label label-news label-added">ADDED</span> Custom Apps

With Custom apps, we're introducing a SaaS-compliant way to have a one size fits one scenario.  
When you don't find an on-the-shelf App answering your exact need on the Akeneo App Store, Custom apps allow you to develop your own app and benefit from all app features without publishing it. 

👉 Learn more about [custom apps](/apps/overview.html#develop-an-app-for-a-custom-need) 


### <span class="label label-news label-added">ADDED</span> Mapping for Apps using catalogs

Using the Catalog feature, you provide your users with a way to create a product selection quickly. 
And now, with the mapping schema, you send all information the PIM needs to display a mapping UI to your users. 

Thanks to the mapping configuration, the PIM flats products to send them in the right structure to your app, 
so you don't need to know the entire Akeneo PIM structure anymore to get product data


👉 Learn more about [how to use the mapping for apps](/apps/catalogs.html#use-the-catalog-product-mapping) 


### <span class="label label-news label-added">ADDED</span> Enriched categories

Creating a great customer experience means providing additional context at every step of their buying journey.  
Therefore Enriched Categories will give Akeneo customers the ability to enrich not just products, but categories as well, including channel- and locale-specific attributes too. 

On API side, you can find:
- a new option `with_enriched_attributes` on the [GET List of categories](/api-reference.html#get_categories) and the [GET a category](/api-reference.html#get_categories__code_) endpoints
- a new [endpoint to download a category media file](/api-reference.html#get_category_media_files__code__download) 

👉 Learn more about [enriched categories on our Help center](https://help.akeneo.com/pim/serenity/articles/enrich-your-category.html)
