# Access scopes

::: warning
This feature is available on all SaaS environments and only since v6 for other types of environments.
:::


Part of the app authorization process requires specifying which parts of Akeneo PIM data the App needs to access.
An App can request any of the access scopes listed below.

::: warning
**Akeneo PIM may not grant all requested scopes.**  
This is up to your App to check which scopes were granted when you receive an Access Token.  
For example, the Community edition will not be able to grant you scopes related to the Asset Manager because
it's a feature only available in the Enterprise edition.
