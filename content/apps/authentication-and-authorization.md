# Authorization and authentication

## Overview

This guide will give you information about OAuth 2.0 and the OpenID concept that you will need when starting the development of your App. 

By following the “getting started” sections below, we will walk you through each of these concepts in a step by step process.

::: tips 
If you simply want to bootstrap an App with predefined authorization scopes to start your development, follow our [Sample Apps](https://github.com/akeneo/sample-apps).
:::

### Authorization vs authentication

**Authorization** is the process of giving permissions to apps. Akeneo users authorize apps to access data in their PXM Studio. For example, an app might be authorized to access product and asset data in a PXM Studio.

**Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of the user or the app. To keep transactions safe and secure, all apps connecting with Akeneo API must authenticate when making API requests.

### Types of authorization and authentication methods

- Akeneo PXM Studio uses OAuth 2.0 to manage app authorizations.
- Any app can use the OpenID Connect protocol to authenticate users coming from Akeneo PXM Studio.

<!------------------------------ end of the Overview ------------------------------------>

## OAuth 2.0

OAuth 2.0 is the industry-standard protocol for authorizing or giving permissions to apps. This differs from authentication, which is the process of verifying the identity of the user or the app.

### The OAuth 2.0 flow

Akeneo uses OAuth 2.0’s authorization code grant flow to issue access tokens on behalf of users. The OAuth flow is used so that Akeneo users can authorize Akeneo apps to access data in a PXM Studio. For example, an app might be authorized to access product and asset data in a store.

The following diagram illustrates the OAuth flow based on the actions of the Akeneo user, your app, and the PXM Studio:

![Schéma OAuth flow](../img/apps/app-activation-sequence-diagram.png)

<!------------------------------ end of the OAuth 2.0 ------------------------------------>

## Getting started with OAuth 2.0

Apps created in the Akeneo App Store must obtain authorization using the [OAuth 2.0 specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) to use Akeneo’s API resources. This guide shows you how to authorize an app using OAuth 2.0.

### What you'll learn

After you've completed this tutorial, you'll be able to authorize an app created in the Akeneo App Store using OAuth 2.0.

### Requirements

- You have your [App developer starter kit](/apps/overview.html#app-developer-starter-kit)
- You're familiar with the [OAuth 2.0 flow](/apps/authentication-and-authorization.html#oauth-20) in Akeneo

### Step 1: Generate API credentials

The first step is to retrieve a **Client id** and a **Client secret**, which you get when you create an app. These API credentials identify your app during the authorization process.

If you've already created an app and generated API credentials, then proceed to [step 2](/apps/authentication-and-authorization.html#step-2-ask-for-authorizations).

1. Log in to your [Akeneo App Store](https://apps.akeneo.com/) account
2. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click [Submit your app for review](https://apps.akeneo.com/node/add/extension)
3. Choose the `App` option
4. Fill in all the required values including **activate and callback URLs** of your app
5. Click on `Save`
6. **Copy and paste your app credentials** and save them carefully as the Akeneo App Store displays them only once


### Step 2: Ask for authorizations

Before an app can access data, a user must grant authorizations and permissions to the app. It happens when a user clicks the `Connect` button to connect your app.

After a user clicks on `Connect`, they are redirected to the **activation URL** you provided. The PXM Studio URL they come from is in the query you receive.

``` http

https://my-app.example.com/oauth/activate?pim_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmy-pim.cloud.akeneo.com
```

When you are ready to do so, you must start the **Authorization Request**. 

Like any other OAuth 2.0 application, you have to redirect the user to the Authorization Server (Akeneo PXM Studio) with the following parameters:

| Query parameter          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `response_type`          | Required. Must always be "code"                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `client_id`              | Required. The client id you get from the Akeneo App Store                                                                                                                                                    |
| `scope`                  | Optional. A space-separated list of scopes. For example, to write products and read assets, use `scope=write_products read_assets`. *Any permission to write a resource includes the permission to read it.* |
| `state`                  | Recommended.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |


``` http

https://my-pim.cloud.akeneo.com/connect/apps/v1/authorize?
    response_type=code&
    client_id=[OAUTH_CLIENT_ID]&
    scope=[REQUESTED_SCOPES]&
    state=[STATE]
```

::: info
To discover all the authorization scopes, please refer to the [Authorization and authentication scopes](/apps/authentication-and-authorization.html#available-authorization-scopes) section.
:::

::: warning
To protect your App from cross-site request forgery, you should send a random string in the `state` parameter.
:::


When the user arrives at this URL, Akeneo shows the following prompt to receive authorization from the user:
![Wizard authorization step](../img/apps/wizard-authorization.png)

When the user ends the connection process, they are redirected to the app **callback URL** with the following parameters:

``` http

https://my-app.example.com/oauth/callback?
    code=[AUTHORIZATION_CODE]&
    state=[STATE]
```

::: warning
If you used a `state` to protect your App from cross-site request forgery, you must validate that the received
state is identical.
:::


### Step 3: Get a permanent access token

Now that you have received an authorization code, you can exchange this code against an access token.

The PIM expects the following parameters in the request:
- `client_id` (required)
- `code` (required)
- `grant_type` (required, must always be "authorization_code")
- `code_identifier` (required)
- `code_challenge` (required)
  
  
#### What's the Code Challenge?

To validate the App identity, Akeneo PIM requires a unique code challenge for each Access Token Request,
instead of the usual client secret.  
The code challenge is composed of 2 keys:
- `code_identifier`: high-entropy cryptographic random string
- `code_challenge`: sha256 hash of the concatenation of `code_identifier` and `client_secret`

Here is a PHP example:
```php
$codeIdentifier = bin2hex(random_bytes(30));
$codeChallenge = hash('sha256', $codeIdentifier . '[CLIENT_SECRET]');
```

#### Token Request

From your server, you must make the following request to the PIM REST API
on the endpoint `/connect/apps/v1/oauth2/token`:

```
POST /connect/apps/v1/oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: my-pim.cloud.akeneo.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=[OAUTH_CLIENT_ID]&code_identifier=[CODE_IDENTIFIER]&code_challenge=[CODE_CHALLENGE]
&code=[AUTHORIZATION_CODE]&grant_type=authorization_code
```

#### Token Success Response

If your Access Token Request is accepted, you will receive a JSON response with the token:

```json
{
  "access_token": "Y2YyYjM1ZjMyMmZlZmE5Yzg0OTNiYjRjZTJjNjk0ZTUxYTE0NWI5Zm",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "scope": "read_products write_products"
}
```

::: warning
You must **store the access token securely**. If you need to ask for a new one, you have to go through the same steps
and wait for the PIM user to manually grant you a new access token.
:::

::: info
An Access Token given to an App has no expiration date. However, be aware that it can be revoked at any moment by a PIM user.
:::

#### Token Error Response

If your Access Token Request is refused, you will receive a JSON response with the error.  

For example, if your app doesn’t retrieve its access token within a 30 seconds delay, you will receive the following error, which indicates that your code is no longer valid. 

```json
{
    "error": "invalid_grant",
    "error_description": "Code has expired"
}
```

Check the [OAuth 2.0 spec](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-5.2) for the possible error codes.


### Step 4: Make authenticated requests

After your app has obtained an API access token, it can make authenticated requests to the REST API.

<!-- `To be validated`  -->
These requests are accompanied by a header Authorization: Bearer {access_token} where {access_token} is replaced with the permanent token.

The following examples show how to retrieve a list of products using the REST API.

<!-- TODO -->

<!-- 
### Step 5: Verify a request

TODO - Shopify example

*Every request or redirect from Akeneo to your app's server includes an **hmac** parameter that can be used to verify the authenticity of the request from Akeneo.*

*For each request, you must remove the **hmac** entry from the query string and process it through an HMAC-SHA256 hash function.*

*The following is an example of a query string. However, request parameters provided by Shopify are subject to change. Your verification strategy shouldn't depend on the parameters in the following example:*

- Explore the [REST API reference](/api-reference-index.html)

<!------------------------------ end of the Authorization ------------------------------------>

## Getting started with OpenID Connect

Apps created in the Akeneo App Store can use the OpenID Connect protocol to authenticate users coming from an Akeneo PXM Studio.

OpenID Connect is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. See [OpenID official website](https://openid.net/connect/) for more info.
Basically, with OpenID Connect, you use the same process as for Authorization, but you request an additional scope and you receive, alongside the Access Token, an ID Token containing the information of the current user. 

![App authentication diagram](../img/apps/app-authentication-sequence-diagram.png)

::: info
This is an optional feature in Apps, you can also use your own Authentication.
:::

### What you'll learn

After you've completed this tutorial, you'll be able to authenticate users coming from an Akeneo PXM Studio using OpenID Connect.

### Requirements

- You have your [App developer starter kit](/apps/overview.html#app-developer-starter-kit)
- You're familiar with [OpenID connect](https://openid.net/connect/)
- You're familiar with the [app authentication process](/apps/authentication-and-authorization.html#getting-started-with-oauth-20)

### Step 1: Ask for authentication scopes

When a user connects to your app **for the first time**, and you want to authenticate them, you must ask for OpenID scopes during the [Authorization request](/apps/authentication-and-authorization.html#step-2-ask-for-authorizations).

``` http
https://my-pim.cloud.akeneo.com/connect/apps/v1/authorize?
        response_type=code&
        client_id=[OAUTH_CLIENT_ID]&
        scope=openid email profile read_products write_products&
        state=[STATE]
```

::: info
To discover all the authentication scopes, please refer to the [Authorization and authentication scopes](/apps/authentication-and-authorization.html#available-authorization-scopes) section.
:::

If a user tries to access your App from their Akeneo PXM Studio, and you want to authenticate them, start an [Authorization request](/apps/authentication-and-authorization.html#step-2-ask-for-authorizations), even if you already are connected to their Akeneo PXM Studio.

During this new Authorization Request, **you must request all the scopes your App needs**, including the Authorization scopes, in addition to the OpenID scopes.


### Step 2: Extract user information

At the end of the OAuth 2.0 process, if your Access Token Request is accepted, you will receive a JSON response with
both tokens:

```json
{
  "access_token": "Y2YyYjM1ZjMyMmZlZmE5Yzg0OTNiYjRjZTJjNjk0ZTUxYTE0NWI5Zm",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "scope": "openid email profile read_products write_products",
  "id_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwOi8vM.XcmmANmSC2RHqWOI"
}
```

#### Decoding the ID Token

An ID Token is a JWT composed of 3 parts encoded independently in base64: `header.payload.signature`.

We recommend using one of the libraries listed [here](https://jwt.io/libraries) with support for `RS256` to decode it
and retrieve the values inside the payload.

::: warning
It's not recommended to try to decode and verify the ID Token yourself.
:::

#### Payload

Once you've decoded the payload, it will look like this:

```json
{
  "iss": "https://my-pim.cloud.akeneo.com",
  "jti": "c76d558d-d10a-4bac-b320-12c22e36b3db",
  "sub": "c6acd619-8a08-46c2-9a5e-41a175d9149d",
  "aud": "206f450e-09a1-44ed-a0b3-9dd80f980ace",
  "iat": 1643029678.467703,
  "exp": 1643033278.467703,
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "firstname": "John",
  "lastname": "Doe"
}
```

| Field       | Description                          |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| `iss`       | URL of the token issuer              |
| `jti`       | Unique identifier for the token      |
| `sub`       | **Unique user id**                   |
| `aud`       | Id of the OAuth 2.0 client           |
| `iat`       | Timestamp of token creation          |
| `exp`       | Timestamp of token expiration        |
| `email`     | **(optional) Email of the user**     |
| `firstname` | **(optional) Firstname of the user** |
| `lastname`  | **(optional) Lastname of the user**  |

Additional information (`email`, `firstname`, `lastname`, ...) are only present if you requested the corresponding
authentication scopes and those were approved by the user.

::: warning
`email`, `firstname` and `lastname` are values that can be edited on Akeneo PIM and are not verified by
Akeneo. The only value that will truly identify a user is their unique user id in the subject claim (`sub`).
:::

#### Signature

The ID Token sent by Akeneo PIM contains a signature, and you must verify it to guarantee that the payload has not be
tampered with.

To validate the signature, you must retrieve the public key available at the
URL `{PIM}/connect/apps/v1/openid/public-key`.

Then, follow the instructions of the library you are using.

::: warning
The pair of private/public keys are regenerated regularly for security reasons. You should always retrieve
the latest public key when validating a signature.

| `email`   | Read user email (from PIM user profile)                    |

<!------------------------------ end of the scopes ------------------------------------>

## Update Authorization and authentication scopes 

It's possible to update the access scopes of an already connected app.
The access scope update process requires app users to consent to new scopes addition. 

### Update the list of required scopes
If your app needs to change the access scopes, it must initiate a new authorization request with all access scopes needed, even the access scopes that are already granted. This new authorization request follows the usual OAuth 2.0 protocol and will end with a new Access Token that reflects updated scopes.

**Some users are not allowed to grant new access scopes in the Akeneo PIM**.  
You should not force users to go through the Authorization process if you haven't received the new access scopes, you could end up in an infinite loop. Consequently, your App must be able to function as usual without the new access scopes.

### Notify a PIM your app requires an authorization update

Through Akeneo REST API, connected apps can notify Akeneo PIM users who can manage your app that the authorization scopes your app requires have changed. 

To do so, use the following `POST` method, with parameters below:

```
https://my-pim.cloud.akeneo.com/connect/apps/v1/scopes/update?scopes=[REQUESTED_SCOPES]
```
Requirements:
- `scopes`: query parameter to specify app new scope list as a space-separated string
- `Authorization: Bearer [AccessToken]`: header to authenticate your app
- `Content-Type: application/json`: header for the response format

The notification will warn them and entice them to open your app so that you can initiate an authorization request with the entire list of required scopes.

Please, be aware that **this endpoint does not update any access scopes**.  
It is only meant to provide a way for an app to warn Akeneo PIM.
