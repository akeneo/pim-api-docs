# PHP developer, you are?
> We have a client for you!

The PHP client facilitates the usage of the REST API in your PHP projects when building extensions and/or tools for your favorite PIM.

## Support & issues
Please be aware that the PHP client is only supported **in best effort**, whether you are an Enterprise or Community customer.

If you ever find a bug, do not hesitate to directly open a Github issue on the [API client repository](https://github.com/akeneo/php-api-client).

Don't forget that we also love when you contribute and help us do better tools. So do not hesitate! Every feedback/pull request is very welcomed!
