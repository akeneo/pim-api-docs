# Akeneo Web API documentation
This repository holds the sources for the documentation of the web API that was released in 1.7.

The API documentation can be found here: [api.akeneo.com](http://api.akeneo.com).

## Installation for dev/preview purposes

### Requirements
- Install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).
- Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Run with docker

```bash
make build
```

The API documentation site is then available on `localhost:8000`.
Files located in the content and src directories are watched for changes, so when developing you do not need to launch any other task.

## Deployment

Your public SSH key should be deployed on the server (see Ansible configuration).

```bash
HOSTNAME=xxx PORT=xxx make deploy
```

HOSTNAME is the server to deploy the documentation on.
PORT is the SSH port to connect to the server.

To know the production and staging environments of api-docs, please read the [inventory](https://github.com/akeneo/ansible/blob/master/inventories/core.inventory).

## Swagger

As our YAML Swagger spec uses references and links, it is considered as non-valid.
During the build, we generate a valid JSON specification that is put under the `content/swagger` folder. Don't forget to version it if you made any change into the YAML Swagger spec.
