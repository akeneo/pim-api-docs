# Akeneo API documentation
This repository holds the sources for the documentation of the REST API that was released in 1.7.

The API documentation can be found here: [api.akeneo.com](http://api.akeneo.com).

## Installation for dev/preview purposes

### Requirements

Install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).

### Build with docker

```bash
make build
```

This is only building the documentation. The documentation is not available with this command, as it does not launch the HTTP server.

### Build and launch HTTP server with docker

```bash
make watch
```

The REST API documentation site is then available on `localhost:8000`.
Files located in the content and src directories are watched for changes, so when developing you do not need to launch any other task.

## Deployment

### Automatic

Once you merge a PR into the `master` branch, it is automatically deployed on the production server. You have nothing to do.

### Manual

In case you want to re deploy the Serenity documentation, [look at the latest merge in master](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/akeneo/pim-api-docs?branch=master) and click on _Deployment_.

Then click on _Rerun_.

## Swagger

As our YAML Swagger spec uses references and links, it is considered as non-valid.
During the build, we generate a valid JSON specification that is put under the `content/swagger` folder. Don't forget to version it if you made any change into the YAML Swagger spec.

### Custom properties

Our Swagger spec is extended with [custom properties](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/2-0/swagger-extensions/):

| Property                 | Type                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `x-from-version`         | `string`                            | Indicates the version the property was added to the API. In the user documentation, hides the property from payload descriptions that doesn't match the selected API version.        |
| `x-examples-per-version` | [[Example object](#example-object)] | Allows to set a payload example for a specific version. Use as a [Response object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#responsesObject) property. |

#### Example object

| Property    | Type     | Description                |
|-------------|----------|----------------------------|
| `x-version` | `string` | API version of the example |
| `x-example` | `any`    | Example payload content    |
